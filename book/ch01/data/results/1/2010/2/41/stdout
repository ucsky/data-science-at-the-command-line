But wearable symbols don't have to be connected to brands. Noncorporate examples range from military patches to motorcycle-gang emblems, but one of the most appealing is the merit badge. While the classic form is associated with youthful scouts, in recent years the merit badge has crossed over into the adult world and is lately getting a digital twist. A popular source for contemporary examples is Nerd Merit Badges, which produces embroidered patches, one and a half inches in diameter with Velcro backs, for $5.99. As the name suggests, Nerd Merit Badges recognize a particular flavor of skills and accomplishments. The ''Open Source'' badge recognizes a successful contribution to any open-source project. ''Been Boinged'' celebrates a project's being mentioned on BoingBoing.net; ''Inbox Zero'' and ''Family Tech Support'' explain themselves.","abstract":"Rob Walker Consumed column examines appeal of Velcro patches produced by company Nerd Merit Badges; photos (M)","print_page":"16","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/06\/13\/magazine\/13fob-consumed\/13fob-consumed-t_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/06\/13\/magazine\/13fob-consumed\/13fob-consumed-t_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Lifelong Earning","kicker":"CONSUMED"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"NERD MERIT BADGES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BADGES"},{"name":"subject","value":"LOGOS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SIGNS AND SYMBOLS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-06-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Rob","lastname":"WALKER"}],"original":"By ROB WALKER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27cf98eb7c8105d84440e","word_count":780},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/08\/05\/fashion\/05CRITIC.html","snippet":"For a shop on Main Street in East Hampton, a chain store\u2019s airily accommodating clothes are edited to the tastes of relatively affluent customers.","lead_paragraph":"East Hampton, N.Y.
