A coral reef, as Animal Planet instructs us, shelters diverse species of sponges, snakes, clownfish and barracudas. So does the garment district. A coral reef is a rich universe with its own organically evolved architecture, home to its own assortment of beasts and weeds. Garment district buildings are the same. Plunge down alongside a reef and hang in the flow, currents eddying around you, and as the designer Yeohlee Teng said recently, ''You never know what is going to swim by.''

Bibhu Mohapatra, an evening-wear designer, had moved into a space down the hall a week earlier, from where he could wave hello. ''Bibhu!'' This has the potential to get annoying. Their new offices, along with those of 10 other designers, are part of an initiative to help emerging fashion businesses grow in New York City -- but that also seems determined to test the adage about what proximity breeds. It is a called a ''fashion business incubator,'' offering below-market rents (starting at $1,500 a month) and mentoring to a group selected by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. And it looks much like a shopping mall, with glass-fronted showrooms on either side of a grand aisle, where designers can create or sell or promote their collections, and retailers can visit all of them conveniently.","abstract":"Eric Wilson Front Row column on new Midtown Manhattan offices for designers, part of initiative to help emerging fashion businesses in New York City grow; Council of Fashion Designers of America selected companies for program; photo (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Garment District Hothouse","kicker":"FRONT ROW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"GURUNG, PRABAL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GARMENT DISTRICT (NYC)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"OFFICE BUILDINGS AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-04-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"WILSON"}],"original":"By ERIC WILSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27e278eb7c8105d846d28","word_count":373},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/04\/25\/nyregion\/25routine-ready.html","snippet":"Ramona Singer, of Bravo\u2019s \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York City,\u201d indulges in a late breakfast and then hits the gym with her husband.","lead_paragraph":"Ramona Singer is among the five original ''housewives'' from the 2008 debut season of the Bravo reality series ''The Real Housewives of New York City.''
