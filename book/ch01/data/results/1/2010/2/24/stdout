The sidewalks displayed everything from the popular fur vest to the fuzzy collars or trimmings on hooded parkas. The big surprise were the foxtails dangling from scarves and handbags, or worn in the back (as nature intended). Others have rediscovered the 1940 and '50s fur stole or multiple-skin scarf, once worn as a decorative ornament, now wrapped snugly around the neck.","abstract":"Bill Cunningham On The Street column describes fur coats and vests worn by women on streets of New York City; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Fabulous, Mr. Fox","kicker":"ON THE STREET"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"FUR"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-12-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"CUNNINGHAM"}],"original":"By BILL CUNNINGHAM"},"type_of_material":"Caption","_id":"4fd285958eb7c8105d8565c8","word_count":80},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE6D81630F93BA15751C0A9669D8B63","snippet":"Fur and all its imitations were worn by many guests attending the recent New York Fashion Week, no doubt prompted at least in part by the bitter cold and snow.

Sukwoo, at the ripe age of 28, already considers himself part of an earlier \"not so beautiful, but perhaps more thoughtful\" generation. For the past four years, he has been filling his Your Boyhood blog (yourboyhood.com) with the photos he takes of Seoul's jeunesse dor\u00e9e and essays that read like sad, disjointed poems (at least when you try to decipher them with your computer's instant translator). For him the blog is still in the early stages of a project he imagines will take him about 10 more years: to record the passing youth of one of Asia's - and the world's - speediest fast-track cultures. \"Young Koreans haven't found their own style yet, so they're copying images they find on the Internet,\" he says. \"It's a form of stylish cosplay.\"","abstract":"A week of boys in lipstick, baby-faced thugs, and party princesses in diamond-studded teddy jackets.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Seoul Survivor | A Front-Row Report From Korean Fashion Week","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-04-05T17:40:25Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Rebecca","rank":1,"lastname":"VOIGHT"}],"original":"By REBECCA VOIGHT"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39a808eb7c8105d8d7cad","word_count":1492},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9D03E0DC1338F932A25750C0A9669D8B63","snippet":"THE Guggenheim's 50th anniversary celebration last week was a magnet for fashion extremists.

Fans stormed the doors at 9 p.m. to hear a performance by Animal Collective. In contrast to the band's incandescent white headdresses, guests wore riotous color: Summer of Love headbands, tomato-color satin frocks and vibrant war paint that suggested ''Avatar.'' There were studied resurrections of Seattle grunge, ''I'm with the band'' T-shirts and festoons of Sgt. Pepper military braid. Upstairs, a benefit auction presided over by the museum's Young Collectors Council was only slightly more sedate, with guests swanning by in sequins and Baudelairean frills. Angelo Chan (bottom left) wears sober tweeds by day, but traded in his banker's cravat that night for a Lanvin velvet butterfly tie.

She sells 200 sizes of bras at Linda's Bra Salon, on Lexington Avenue, with a second shop scheduled to open in Murray Hill this fall. The beginning: My children were in school, I was bored, I had to do something, and I read that women's lingerie was the fastest-growing industry in the country for women. I thought, ''That's something I would have fun doing.'' When I opened up the lingerie store, I thought I'd be selling robes and nightgowns and pretty slippers. Shortly after, the American Cancer Society asked would I go to school to learn to fit bras for prostheses and bras for mastectomies, because no one was doing it in my area.

So far, Manish Arora, who showed his over-the-top collection to cheers last week, is India's biggest international fashion success story.
