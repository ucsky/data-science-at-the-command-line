Chinese authorities are slow to enforce the law, and it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to tell which shoes are real.","lead_paragraph":"A shopkeeper in Italy placed an order with a Chinese sneaker factory in Putian for 3,000 pairs of white Nike Tiempo indoor soccer shoes. It was early February, and the shopkeeper wanted the Tiempos pronto. Neither he nor Lin, the factory manager, were authorized to make Nikes. They would have no blueprints or instructions to follow. But Lin didn't mind. He was used to working from scratch. A week later, Lin, who asked that I only use his first name, received a pair of authentic Tiempos, took them apart, studied their stitching and molding, drew up his own design and oversaw the production of 3,000 Nike clones. A month later, he shipped the shoes to Italy. ''He'll order more when there's none left,'' Lin told me recently, with confidence. Lin has spent most of his adult life making sneakers, though he only entered the counterfeit business about five years ago. ''What we make depends on the order,'' Lin said. ''But if someone wants Nikes, we'll make them Nikes.'' Putian, a ''nest'' for counterfeit-sneaker manufacturing, as one China-based intellectual-property lawyer put it, is in the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian, just across the strait from Taiwan. In the late 1980s, multinational companies from all industries started outsourcing production to factories in the coastal provinces of Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang. Industries tended to cluster in specific cities and subregions. For Putian, it was sneakers. By the mid-1990s, a new brand of factory, specializing in fakes, began copying authentic Nike, Adidas, Puma and Reebok shoes. Counterfeiters played a low-budget game of industrial espionage, bribing employees at the licensed factories to lift samples or copy blueprints. Shoes were even chucked over a factory wall, according to a worker at one of Nike's Putian factories. It wasn't unusual for counterfeit models to show up in stores before the real ones did.","abstract":"Nicholas Schmidle article notes that making counterfeit tennis shoes has become a very big business in southern China; asserts that Chinese authorities are slow to enforce the law, and that it is becoming harder and harder to distinguish between real and counterfeit shoes; photos (L)","print_page":"38","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/08\/22\/magazine\/22fake-span\/22fake-t_CA2-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/08\/22\/magazine\/22fake-span\/22fake-t_CA2-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/08\/22\/magazine\/22fake-span\/22fake-span-articleLarge.jpg","height":400,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/08\/22\/magazine\/22fake-span\/22fake-span-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":400},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Inside the Knockoff Factory"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CHINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOES AND BOOTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"COUNTERFEIT MERCHANDISE"},{"name":"subject","value":"SNEAKERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-08-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Nicholas","lastname":"SCHMIDLE"}],"original":"By NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b73c8eb7c8105d8abf83","word_count":4159},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/16\/out-of-the-oven-the-new-museums-new-cookie\/","snippet":"I dropped by for a preview of the museum's latest attraction: a spruced-up cafe, co-created by Maury Rubin of the City Bakery and Birdbath, Green Neighborhood Bakery.","lead_paragraph":"Fashion writers dream of the day when they get an exclusive sneak peek at a visionary designer's next collection.
