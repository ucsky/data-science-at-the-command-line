Guests, including celebrities like Hillary Swank and Matt Dillon, filed behind the stage and into a massive tent with an L.E.D.-lit dance floor and high-tech digital projections, not to mention four full bars, servers circling with magnums of Champagne and - get this - an open invitation to smoke. Try getting that kind of treatment in New York these days, where austerity is the new black.
