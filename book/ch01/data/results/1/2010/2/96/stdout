And there is a bountiful supply of mice that, thanks to the addition of a jellyfish gene, literally glow either red or green in the dark. Under the microscope, their blood-forming stem cells, a particular interest of Dr. Mukherjee's right now, shine like tiny Christmas lights.

On a recent Monday afternoon in the East Village, the 32-year-old upstart photographer Todd Selby -- more commonly known as the Selby -- was entertaining a guest in his modest ground-floor studio. One of the two monitors on which he creates his teeming online gallery, The Selby Is in Your Place, was tuned to a Web site called Unhappy Hipsters. The idea behind the site -- which that week was reaching something of a viral mass -- is pretty straightforward: cut and paste a selection of those placid, sparsely populated house shots from magazines like Dwell and run the snarkiest captions imaginable beneath them. ''He'd become a caricature of what it meant to be a young, monied follower'' is a typical entry. ''Oh, my God,'' Selby said, scrolling through the site with what appeared to be a mixture of astonishment and appreciation, as if meeting a fellow traveler. After all, Selby's v\u00e9rit\u00e9 approach to photographing personal spaces is precisely in tune with the urge to skewer those magazines that celebrate sleek minimalism while scorning clutter like the long-suffering mother of a teenage son.","abstract":"New breed of design chroniclers include upstart photographer Todd Selby, whose online gallery, The Selby Is in Your Place, embraces clutter and skewers magazines like Architectural Digest that celebrate sleek minimalism; others include Apartamento magazine, founded by Nacho Alegre, Omar Sosa and Marco Velardi, and interiors blog Homebodies by New York-based design writer Liz Arnold; photos (L)","print_page":"62","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"How This Half Lives","kicker":"TALK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ARNOLD, LIZ"},{"name":"persons","value":"SELBY, TODD"},{"name":"persons","value":"SOSA, OMAR"},{"name":"persons","value":"VELARDI, MARCO"},{"name":"persons","value":"ALEGRE, NACHO"},{"name":"persons","value":"KUSAMA, YAYOI"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST"},{"name":"organizations","value":"APARTAMENTO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DWELL"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERIOR DESIGN"},{"name":"subject","value":"MAGAZINES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BLOGS AND BLOGGING (INTERNET)"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOME FURNISHINGS"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}],"pub_date":"2010-04-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Design Magazine","section_name":"Technology; Arts; Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Mark","lastname":"ROZZO"}],"original":"By MARK ROZZO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a6998eb7c8105d88f256","word_count":1482},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9906E4DF1E38F931A25751C1A9669D8B63","snippet":"DEMONSTRATING either a solid fan base for Web video, or the networking ability of Web video makers, the first Watchlist column last month drew a strong response, with readers recommending close to a hundred serials, films, podcasts and sites.    ...","lead_paragraph":"DEMONSTRATING either a solid fan base for Web video, or the networking ability of Web video makers, the first Watchlist column last month drew a strong response, with readers recommending close to a hundred serials, films, podcasts and sites.
