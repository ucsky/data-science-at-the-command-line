They knocked the icicles off the fountain, put a tent over it and displayed their looks for fall inside. About 70 shows took place under the tents while 100 other designers showed in locations all over Manhattan. The audience of thousands presented their own spectacle going to the shows. The standout was the long leg -- covered or (a bigger surprise) a revival of the nude leg amid leggings, high boots and impossibly high shoes. Several designers put forth the idea of longer midcalf skirts (like Marc Jacobs, left of the limo). Here we go again: the matronly look.","abstract":"Women attending New York Fashion Week don extremely high heels and distinctive hosiery; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"In Stride","kicker":"ON THE STREET"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOES AND BOOTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOSIERY"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"CUNNINGHAM"}],"original":"By BILL CUNNINGHAM"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a4f78eb7c8105d88c481","word_count":112},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/12\/photos-of-the-moment-chadwick-bell-fashion-show-mr-brainwash-party\/","snippet":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Elle Muliarchyk.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Elle Muliarchyk.","abstract":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Elle Muliarchyk.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photos of the Moment | Chadwick Bell Fashion Show, Mr. Brainwash Party","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-12T11:53:57Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Elle","rank":1,"lastname":"MULIARCHYK"}],"original":"By ELLE MULIARCHYK"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3994d8eb7c8105d8d504a","word_count":18},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/04\/15\/fashion\/15CRITIC.html","snippet":"Self Edge is a small store on Orchard Street that offers a daunting range of artisanal denim, tough enough for motorcyclists.","lead_paragraph":"AS the water line crept higher and higher in the bathtub, it was hard not to think I had been hornswoggled.

Buffalo, N.Y., alone had maybe 15 family-owned men's-wear shops selling what a certain three-hankie film would universally popularize as the preppy look. By the time Ralph Lifshitz paid a sales call on O'Connell's, the only pre-''Love Story'' haberdasher still operating in the Queen City, he was already the tie designer Ralph Lauren, and you have to assume he was paying attention. Still owned by one of its founders, Bernhard Huber, O'Connell's can feel good about keeping the local university dons in regulation Greek fishermen caps, needlepoint belts with a panorama of sea turtles and tweed lidded Champagne coolers, built like tanks to double as shooting stools on Kenyan safaris. In the spirit, practically, of furthering the species, the store furnishes a historical corrective -- no witty elbows in the side -- to the neo madness of lines like Ralph's Rugby and Andr\u00e9 Benjamin's dead-in-the-water Benjamin Bixby collection. If you're Thom Browne or Band of Outsiders' Scott Sternberg and the inspiration well is running a little dry, a Saturday spent tanking up and resetting your compass at O'Connell's is a day well spent. And if you're in the cuff links or underwear business, it's a good place to see what's moving. Bamboo and sterling silver links tied with bonefishing flies: not so much. Full ''gentleman's-cut'' broadcloth boxers with single-panel backs and no-chafe waistbands: huge.","abstract":"Scene inside O'Connell's, family-owned haberdasher in Buffalo, NY, described; photos (L)","print_page":"98","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/09\/12\/t-magazine\/12talk-petkanas\/12talk-petkanas-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/09\/12\/t-magazine\/12talk-petkanas\/12talk-petkanas-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Buffalo Hunting","kicker":"TALK"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"BUFFALO (NY)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"HERMES INTERNATIONAL"},{"name":"organizations","value":"O'CONNELL'S"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BURBERRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Men's Fashion Magazine","section_name":"Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Christopher","lastname":"PETKANAS"}],"original":"By CHRISTOPHER PETKANAS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd281d58eb7c8105d84e8bc","word_count":1044},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE2DB1F38F936A35751C1A9669D8B63","snippet":"With the Chinese buying cars by the tens of thousands every week -- big cars, too -- and throwing up new buildings, driving in Beijing is no lark.

It was an hour before Guo Pei and her husband, Bao Jie Cao, reached the headquarters of Rose Studio, their fashion company, on the city's north side. The October sun was blazing pale when their Mercedes pulled up to a low-rise office complex, its white brick rendered shabby by newer developments. Bao, a stocky, good-looking Taiwanese man who goes by the name Jack, had been kneeling the whole time next to the driver; facing his wife, who sat in the back; and translating from Chinese into English. Now he sort of backed out of the car. Guo Pei, whose career as a fashion designer began when there was no fashion in her country, remained a study in Asian poise and etiquette. In addition to large eyes and delicate features, enhanced by careful makeup, she has a gentleness unmarred by circumstance. These circumstances include wealth and a list of clients in Beijing's highest political, media and social circles. But as Jack said proudly, ''Guo Pei is a very traditional lady -- a wonderful wife and daughter and mother who always cares more about her family than the attention she receives.'' Be that as it may, nobody, upon learning that Beijing has its own couturi\u00e8re, would ever imagine such a salon. Rose Studio's d\u00e9cor goes well beyond Chinese standards -- in fact, its excessiveness suggests that in her ideas Guo Pei is anything but modest. Along one wall are display cases of dresses in gold and Easter shades of blue and yellow, behind which are lighted panels of doily-white filigree rising to the mirrored ceiling. A glittering staircase, as wide as those in a musical, is ornamented with bronze vines. Coiled around its base, like a fat, drowsy serpent, is a tufted green damask banquette. Several assistants, half-hidden by vases of red silk flowers, work at a large white table. In the center of the room is a molded silver chair in the shape of three plump breasts.","abstract":"Profile of Chinese high-fashion designer Guo Pei; photos (L)","print_page":"134","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Year of the Couturiere","kicker":"TALK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"GUO PEI"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-12-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Holiday Magazine","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd285958eb7c8105d85655e","word_count":1996},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9406E4DE1131F934A25753C1A9669D8B63","snippet":"For the past week I've been in Beijing, my first trip to China.

And what did I expect of this remarkable, sprawling, fast-changing city? Today - Friday in Beijing - I had lunch with Angelica Cheung, the editor in chief of Vogue China, at the China Grill on the 66th floor of the Park Hyatt, and since I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early, I took a moment to press my nose to the windows. The sprawl of new buildings - skyscrapers, hotels, apartment blocks - is almost unfathomable and seemingly endless. In front of me was the CCTV building, by Rem Koolhaas, with its twin cantilevered towers. A second building on the site caught fire during the New Year's celebration and burned, leaving a charred hulk, and the area around the complex is still under construction. Still, the dazzling architecture reminds you that you're looking at a new world. My eyes kept coming back to the Koolhaas building.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn On The Runway column describes her experience shopping for luxury fashion goods in Beijing, China; photo (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"China Surprise","kicker":"ON THE RUNWAY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"BEIJING (CHINA)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-10-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd282af8eb7c8105d850786","word_count":580},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/12\/19\/fashion\/19Diane.html","snippet":"The American fashion designer is using her art and media connections to make inroads in the competitive fashion market of China.","lead_paragraph":"BEIJING ON a chilly morning in Beijing earlier this month, the American fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg was getting theatrical in the conference room of an art gallery in the city's 798 Arts District.
