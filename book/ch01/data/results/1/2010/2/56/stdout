The Andaz property, part of an entirely new brand for Hyatt, is a far cry from last year's extremes of old-school opulence and flophouse chic. In June, the unabashedly luxurious Pierre Hotel reopened, flaunting a $100 million renovation and posting room rates of the \"if you have to ask ...\" variety. Then the Crosby Hotel opened, with each of the 86 rooms awash in bespoke fabric and art, and priced to match. Conversely, the aggressively gritty Ace and Jane Hotels, the latter featuring communal bathrooms, promised hipster cred on the cheap.","abstract":"Signs point to a theme among many of New York's new hotels: recession luxe.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Checking In | The New Middle","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-01-21T17:25:37Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jackie","rank":1,"lastname":"COOPERMAN"}],"original":"By JACKIE COOPERMAN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd399248eb7c8105d8d490b","word_count":441},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/08\/28\/nyregion\/28metjournal.html","snippet":"In a Brooklyn neighborhood, a group of \u201cfriends and co-conspirators\u201d enjoy Grub, a communal dinner made from wasted food recovered from the trash.","lead_paragraph":"The Dumpster divers started their bicycle run just after nightfall on a summer Friday, rolling through the steamy streets of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, stopping only to dig through trash bags and pull out produce.
