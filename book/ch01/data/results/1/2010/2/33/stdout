After only three collections, Mr. Louie, 25, has emerged as a name to watch and to drop, thanks to his brand of esoteric glamour, with influences including surf culture and samurai armor. (He showed a video presentation Feb. 12 as part of New York Fashion Week.) For her part, Ms. Jablonski, 17, used the runway for takeoff last year; she walked a staggering 58 shows in her freshman season -- including Balenciaga and Prada -- and landed the cK Jeans campaign.
