I want to revisit some amazing shoe collaborations that took place during New York fashion week. Maria Cornejo, for example, teamed up with George Esquivel, the West Coast cobbler, to create the shoes for her first men's-wear collection. The result was a simple oxford with a leather stripe slashed diagonally across the front. It was as if she had translated her sculptural clothing style into footwear.","abstract":"Let's step back a minute, shall we?

''We all know what happened to New York,'' the promoter added, citing a well-rehearsed litany: AIDS, night-life crackdowns, bottles-and-models bars, the Crash and, then, the Slump. ''Rents went up and pushed out the artists, hedge-fund types came in and creativity died,'' Mr. Khan said.

(Did we mention this was the '80s?) The MCM ads were equally flashy, featuring Crawford perched on a pile of suitcases or posing wearing nothing except a giant MCM logo. (If that weren't enough, they were signed \"I want my MCM\" and \"The beginning of a beautiful friendship.\" Awwww.) And while you might think that such naked consumption went the way of the world economy, you would think wrong. Not only has the brand been on a store opening spree with 15 new Saks Fifth Avenue boutiques and a Beverly Hills Rodeo Drive boutique scheduled for later this year, but it has signed on as a sponsor for New York fashion week. MCM is even recreating its Cindy Crawford campaign, this time around with the model Coco Rocha. Under the circumstances, the images are a bit more modest - Rocha's mane is tamed down, and she's wearing a bustier dress - but the message is not lost.","abstract":"MCM (Mode Creation Munich), the Euro leather goods brand popular in the '80s, is making a comeback.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"I Want My MCM","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-04-06T12:35:22Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Sarah","rank":1,"lastname":"LEON"}],"original":"By SARAH LEON"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39ab88eb7c8105d8d85e8","word_count":210},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/10\/27\/pop-up-window-shopping\/","snippet":"The married duo behind the eclectic boutique Project No. 8 have created a pop-up store in a 100-square-foot former gallery in TriBeCa.","lead_paragraph":"Another day, another pop-up store.

The TriBeCa space will be open through Valentine's Day 2011, and Beer and Janusiak are opening another pop-up store in Paris next month.","abstract":"The married duo behind the eclectic boutique Project No. 8 have created a pop-up store in a 100-square-foot former gallery in TriBeCa.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Pop-Up Window Shopping","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-10-27T18:00:40Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"BARSAMIAN"}],"original":"By EDWARD BARSAMIAN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39d3d8eb7c8105d8de43d","word_count":170},{"web_url":"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/22\/selling-a-celebrity-look-with-a-click\/","snippet":"While fashion lovers have always scoured fashion and gossip magazines to steal trendy ideas from the rich and famous, the Internet has made it easier for readers to shop for those celebrities' looks, The New York Times says.","lead_paragraph":"The paparazzi tracked down Angelina Jolie and four of her children in Venice last week, snapping photos of them eating ice cream.

The ones who did that are looking pretty smart right now, because there are even more new ideas to try in 2011. Probably the most important accomplishment for Web-resistant designers was to recognize that their customers talk to one another online; they want girlfriend advice and they want designers to listen. As a result, many more designers this year began using Facebook and Twitter. Customers also want more access to a designer's world, and they want to be able to do that through their cellphones and tablets.
