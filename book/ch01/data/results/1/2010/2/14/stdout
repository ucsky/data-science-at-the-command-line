One reason is the popular layering trend, in which designers have shown jackets over vests over sweaters over dresses, and putting together those looks in their stores will logically require customers to make multiple purchases. One of those layers in particular has excited retailers, as it represents a potential revival of a category that was long ago ceded to dance-wear specialists and juniors chains at the mall. That would be leg warmers. Variations were shown at Rag & Bone, for men and women; at Michael Kors; in the first look of the Thakoon collection; at Derek Lam; and, with extra-long ones all over the runway, at Alexander Wang.","abstract":"Several designers show leg warmers on fall fashion runways; observers say that it is classic 1980s touch to go with modern layering; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Don't Worry, Aerobics Are Optional","kicker":"FRONT ROW"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"SHOPPING AND RETAIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"WILSON"}],"original":"By ERIC WILSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27be08eb7c8105d84182c","word_count":306},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/02\/fashion-week-preview-the-faces\/","snippet":"Now that we're practically on a first-name basis with Doutzen, Lakshmi and Anja, it's time we meet Bambi, Fei Fei and Kat.","lead_paragraph":"Now that we're practically on a first-name basis with Doutzen, Lakshmi and Anja, it's time we meet Bambi, Fei Fei and Kat.

''It took me a long time in the business to realize I didn't have to do everything people told me I should if I wanted a career.'' Ms. Rocha is a model. Who isn't nowadays? It used to be that kids wanted to grow up to be astronauts, police officers or doctors. Now it would appear that modeling is the career default of anybody who doesn't have two heads. Ms. Rocha, according to a well-rehearsed story, was discovered by a scout at an Irish dancing contest in her native Vancouver, British Columbia. Whatever her real name is (apparently Mikhaila, which lacks the show-business pop of Coco), it was quickly altered, and she was sent to see Steven Meisel, the photographer who is fashion's resident Pygmalion. Mr. Meisel photographed her in 2006 for the cover of Italian Vogue, and there followed in short order a series of high-profile jobs on catwalks, in magazine editorials and in advertising campaigns -- enough of them to fill three fat paragraphs on her Web r\u00e9sum\u00e9.","abstract":"Guy Trebay Fashion Diary profiles model Coco Rocha, working for Diane von Furstenberg during New York Fashion Week; photo (M)","print_page":"28","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Model's Prospects: Slim and None","kicker":"FASHION DIARY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VON FURSTENBERG, DIANE"},{"name":"persons","value":"ROCHA, COCO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"WEIGHT"},{"name":"subject","value":"MODELS (PROFESSIONAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Guy","lastname":"TREBAY"}],"original":"By GUY TREBAY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27be28eb7c8105d841a3a","word_count":753},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9900E0D6123AF935A2575AC0A9669D8B63","snippet":"    The Nocturnalist goes to New York Fashion Week.
