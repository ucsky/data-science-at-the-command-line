Mr. Jacobs, in a formal mood, was wearing a three-piece suit but had removed the jacket. Out front, where the floor and specially built walls were covered with brown cardboard, giving the aura of a giant box, guests milled around. The photographers, without celebrities to snap (none had been invited) were like chickens idly pecking around a barnyard. And so all was calm at Marc Jacobs, in contrast to previous seasons when the scene was part of the fun, crushing or not. Then, too, Mr. Jacobs was interested in conceptual collections, involving a set, and afterward journalists would troop backstage to unearth the meaning.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn reviews assesses New York collections of Marc Jacobs and Rodarte; photos (M)","print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"American Style, Way Up High","kicker":"FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"JACOBS, MARC"},{"name":"organizations","value":"RODARTE"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd278478eb7c8105d83aaec","word_count":535},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/08\/nyregion\/08rosh.html","snippet":"Caught between the Labor Day weekend and European shows, organizers of New York\u2019s Fashion Week say they had no choice but to stage the event during Rosh Hashana.","lead_paragraph":"As Jewish families gather to celebrate the New Year on Wednesday night, there are sure to be some fashion designers whispering prayers of their own.

Marc Jacobs, after all, has declared repeatedly that it's fine -- indeed modern -- to ''sample'' the work of his predecessors, thereby giving implicit permission to rafts of his peers to ''pay homage'' to the past. So it was hardly surprising to find a number of designers taking his message to heart -- some hitching their carts, as did Mr. Jacobs, to the likes of Yves Saint Laurent; others, to Helmut Lang. It was Mr. Lang, you may recall, who with his willfully dour cohort -- cutting-edge Belgians like Ann Demeulemeester and Martin Margiela -- introduced deconstruction to the runways in the late '80s and early '90s, rending then reassembling their designs in a way meant to point out that fashion itself is in constant flux.","abstract":"Designers exhibiting collections at New York Fashion Week reveal styles inspired by the elegant drapery and tailoring of Saint Laurent and the urban cool of Helmut Lang; photos (M)","print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/09\/16\/fashion\/zTrends-B\/zTrends-B-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/09\/16\/fashion\/zTrends-B\/zTrends-B-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Brazen or Subtle, Mining the Past","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LANG, HELMUT"},{"name":"persons","value":"SAINT LAURENT, YVES"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a8568eb7c8105d892ec8","word_count":509},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09preview.html","snippet":"Four designers whose shows insiders will be watching closely during Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"THE fashion calendar is glutted with scores of young hopefuls jostling to make their mark during New York Fashion Week. Some will attain the brief but glorious life span of a butterfly, spreading their wings for a season or two, while others will demonstrate formidable staying power. Among the more than 100 designers showing their spring-summer 2011 collections at Lincoln Center and elsewhere around town are a handful of strikingly inventive talents who have caught the eye of influential insiders. Some of those tastemakers are beaming their attention on Gary Graham (Sept. 11, Milk Studios). A graduate of the Chicago Art Institute, Mr. Graham began his career as a textile and costume designer, introducing his fashion label a decade ago. His somewhat nostalgic designs are inspired, he said, by an amalgam of period influences: old botanical engravings, Romany culture and Dust Bowl portraits, to name a few. Mr. Graham's repurposed fabrics and trims are catnip to clients at ABC Carpet & Home and at his flagship boutique in TriBeCa.","abstract":"Profile of four designers--Tom Scott, Gary Graham, Tess Giberson and Wes Gordon--whose shows insiders will be watching closely during New York Fashion Week; photos (M)","print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09preview-span\/09preview-span-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09preview-span\/09preview-span-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09preview-span\/09preview-span-articleLarge.jpg","height":382,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09preview-span\/09preview-span-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":382},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Where the Future Stars May Be","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"GORDON, WES"},{"name":"persons","value":"SCOTT, TOM"},{"name":"persons","value":"GIBERSON, TESS"},{"name":"persons","value":"GRAHAM, GARY"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a8558eb7c8105d892e48","word_count":441},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09lincoln.html","snippet":"Fashion Week begins its run at Lincoln Center on Thursday after 17 years in Bryant Park.

That's the general idea of Fashion Week, which began on Thursday in the industry's splashy new arena, and to be sure, ''Project Runway'' is a long way from Wagner, just as Christian Siriano is no Karl Lagerfeld, who was honored by the Couture Council at a luncheon on Friday at Avery Fisher Hall.
