Both designers were into fur, asymmetrical pleating and tailored dresses so tight they looked pasted on. Mr. Posen's were a little shorter. Unless you don't care for that kind of fancy dressing, you couldn't really fault either collection. Mrs. Herrera, whose company recently underwent some management changes, seemed to put more of herself into the clothes. There was drama in a camel and sable coat with wide-leg trousers, and in a one-shoulder magenta and silver jacquard dress, with a crescent of red velvet rising at the bodice, but it was a drama that made sense.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn reviews New York Fashion Week collections of Carolina Herrera, Caroline Seikaly, Diane von Furstenberg, Maria Cornejo, Thakoon Panichgul, Victoria Beckham and Zac Posen; photos (M)","print_page":"28","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Messages in Fit and Folklore","kicker":"FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"POSEN, ZAC"},{"name":"persons","value":"VON FURSTENBERG, DIANE"},{"name":"persons","value":"CORNEJO, MARIA"},{"name":"persons","value":"HERRERA, CAROLINA"},{"name":"persons","value":"SEIKALY, CAROLINE"},{"name":"persons","value":"PANICHGUL, THAKOON"},{"name":"persons","value":"BECKHAM, VICTORIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd2a69b8eb7c8105d88f504","word_count":830},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09ROUND.html","snippet":"Six rising-star designers discuss their inspirations, their aspirations and the pressures of Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"THEY are not exactly a New York Six.

Not a decade ago, the captains of industry were asking themselves who could revive American fashion in the eyes of the world, since the big guns of New York had grown stale, retired or expired, and Paris reclaimed the mantle as the place to be. A Paris Six emerged, as Cathy Horyn, fashion critic for The New York Times, noted in 2005, citing a small group of designers who held the most profound influence over global fashion at the moment, comparable to the Antwerp Six of the early 1990s, or the Japanese designers who dominated Paris in the two decades prior.","abstract":"Six rising-star designers--Max Osterweis, Joseph Altuzarra, Alexa Adams, Sophie Theallet, Patrik Ervell and Wayne Lee--discuss their inspirations, their aspirations and the pressures of New York Fashion Week; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09NEXT-span\/Z-NEXT-P1-A-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09NEXT-span\/Z-NEXT-P1-A-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09NEXT-span\/Z-NEXT-P1-A-articleLarge.jpg","height":400,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/09\/09\/fashion\/09NEXT-span\/Z-NEXT-P1-A-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":400},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"The Next Wave","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BROWN, JANET"},{"name":"persons","value":"ALTUZARRA, JOSEPH"},{"name":"persons","value":"THEALLET, SOPHIE"},{"name":"persons","value":"ERVELL, PATRIK"},{"name":"persons","value":"ADAMS, ALEXA"},{"name":"persons","value":"LEE, WAYNE"},{"name":"persons","value":"OSTERWEIS, MAX"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"WILSON"}],"original":"By ERIC WILSON"},"type_of_material":"Question","_id":"4fd29c708eb7c8105d87dcb0","word_count":4767},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/02\/10\/fashion\/20100211-bryant-slideshow_index.html","snippet":"Since 1993, the big tent in Bryant Park has changed the world\u2019s perception of American fashion.","lead_paragraph":"Since 1993, the big tent in Bryant Park has changed the world\u2019s perception of American fashion.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Big Tent, Moving On "},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COUNCIL OF FASHION DESIGNERS OF AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BRYANT PARK (NYC)"},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2010-02-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8c441c22dfde670c4216","word_count":25},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/14\/fashion\/14REVIEW.html","snippet":"Reviews of Tommy Hilfiger, Diane Von Furstenberg, Thakoon, Wes Gordon and others.","lead_paragraph":"Only afterward did I realize that the invitation for Tommy Hilfiger's show was a plastic swatch of privet contained in a clean white box.
