It was an hour before Guo Pei and her husband, Cao Bao Jie, reached the headquarters of Rose Studio, their fashion company, on the city's north side. The October sun was blazing pale when their Mercedes pulled up to a low-rise office complex, its white brick rendered shabby by newer developments. Cao, a stocky, good-looking Taiwanese man who goes by the name Jack, had been kneeling the whole time next to the driver; facing his wife, who sat in the back; and translating from Chinese into English. Now he sort of backed out of the car. Guo Pei, whose career as a fashion designer began when there was no fashion in her country, remained a study in Asian poise and etiquette. In addition to large eyes and delicate features, enhanced by careful makeup, she has a gentleness unmarred by circumstance. These circumstances include wealth and a list of clients in Beijing's highest political, media and social circles. But as Jack said proudly, ''Guo Pei is a very traditional lady - a wonderful wife and daughter and mother who always cares more about her family than the attention she receives.''","abstract":"Guo Pei is giving Paris some stiff - and heavily embroidered - competition.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Year of the Couturi\u00e8re","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-12-01T12:25:21Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Cathy","rank":1,"lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39e2d8eb7c8105d8e0663","word_count":1992},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/01\/15\/chic-in-review-kate-moss-drops-a-habit\/","snippet":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","lead_paragraph":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","abstract":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chic in Review | Kate Moss Drops a Habit","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-01-15T17:45:39Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Sarah","rank":1,"lastname":"LEON"}],"original":"By SARAH LEON"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd398c98eb7c8105d8d3b40","word_count":399},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/10\/20\/the-insider-sara-rotman\/","snippet":"Rotman, interior designer and multihyphenate, on her favorite eateries, pubs, books and more.","lead_paragraph":"The Insider is a recurring profile of emerging tastemakers in the fields of fashion, design, food, travel and the arts.","abstract":"Rotman, interior designer and multihyphenate, on her favorite eateries, pubs, books and more.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Insider | Sara Rotman","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-10-20T11:28:53Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Chelsea","rank":1,"lastname":"ZALOPANY"}],"original":"By CHELSEA ZALOPANY"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39d9f8eb7c8105d8df4c3","word_count":910},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/01\/21\/scorecard-z-zegna-wins\/","snippet":"Z Zegna dazzled with techno tailoring, while the Caten brothers would have been well advised to stick with trucker hats.","lead_paragraph":"The Paris men's-wear shows kick off today, but somehow critics are still filing reviews from Tuesday's shows.

His eyes were hooded, but his attire was buoyant: a smart Paul Stuart suit and a blue gingham shirt and knit tie by Charvet. His honey-blond hair, no longer the peroxide blond of the skateboarder who once built a half-pipe in his Connecticut backyard, was cropped on the sides, Wall Street style.","abstract":"Alex Williams Up Close column profiles entrepreneur Paul Sevigny, who recently opened NoLIta restaurant Kenmare with his partner Nur Khan; Sevigny acknowledges his passion for new ventures and says that there are many avenues available to him rather than following one career; photo (M)","print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paul Sevigny's Next Act","kicker":"UP CLOSE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SEVIGNY, PAUL"},{"name":"persons","value":"KHAN, NUR"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NOLITA (NYC)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BEATRICE INN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"KENMARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESTAURANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"DISC JOCKEYS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NIGHTCLUBS AND CABARETS"}],"pub_date":"2010-04-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Alex","lastname":"WILLIAMS"}],"original":"By ALEX WILLIAMS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29c138eb7c8105d87ce39","word_count":866},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/11\/remembering-alexander-mcqueen\/","snippet":"The editors of T recall their favorite memories of the British fashion designer.","lead_paragraph":"The editors of T recall their favorite memories of Alexander McQueen, who was found dead in his London home on Thursday.","abstract":"The editors of T recall their favorite memories of the British fashion designer.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Remembering Alexander McQueen","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-11T18:20:35Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By T MAGAZINE EDITORS"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3995b8eb7c8105d8d5378","word_count":1098},{"web_url":"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2010\/01\/14\/christmas-could-boost-matalan-sale-talks\/","snippet":"A surge in Christmas sales at discount fashion retailer Matalan could reinvigorate a sale process that has run slowly since private equity houses first expressed an interest in the chain in October.","lead_paragraph":"A surge in Christmas sales at the British discount fashion retailer Matalan could reinvigorate a sale process that has run slowly since private equity houses first expressed an interest in the chain in October.","abstract":"A surge in Christmas sales at discount fashion retailer Matalan could reinvigorate a sale process that has run slowly since private equity houses first expressed an interest in the chain in October.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Christmas Could Boost Matalan Sale Talks","kicker":"DealBook"},"keywords":[{"rank":"2","name":"subject","value":"Private Equity"},{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-01-14T04:47:04Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Business Day","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By DEALBOOK"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd399248eb7c8105d8d4926","word_count":349}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
