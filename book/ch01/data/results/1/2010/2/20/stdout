The rock band led by the superlatively erratic frontman Axl Rose, right, played a surprise set at theJohn Varvatos store in the East Village.

The Web site BrooklynVegan.com reported that Mr. Rose and his band appeared early Friday morning after a Thursday night performance by the New York rock group Alberta Cross and proceeded to play 17 songs over 90 minutes. The set list provided by BrooklynVegan.com heavily favored tracks from the band's hit 1987 album ''Appetite For Destruction'' and largely avoided songs from its 2008 follow-up, ''Chinese Democracy.'' No roster was given for the band, which has changed its lineup more than a few times under Mr. Rose's direction.","abstract":"Guns N' Roses, led by frontman Axl Rose, plays surprise set at John Varvatos store in East Village during New York Fashion Week; photo (S)","print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Guns N' Roses Plays Fashion Week Show","kicker":"ARTS, BRIEFLY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VARVATOS, JOHN"},{"name":"persons","value":"ROSE, AXL"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GUNS N' ROSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRADE SHOWS AND FAIRS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Dave","lastname":"ITZKOFF"}],"original":"Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27be28eb7c8105d841a0a","word_count":147},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/06\/20\/fashion\/20DIARY.html","snippet":"Florence has become a hot stop on the men\u2019s fashion calendar.","lead_paragraph":"Florence, Italy CLUTCHING a bunch of long-stemmed flowers, Mark McNairy held them just below his belt buckle and gave a hired party photographer a leering grin.","abstract":"Guy Trebay Fashion Diary column describes parties and fashion shows in Florence, Italy, which has become hot stop on the men's fashion calendar; photos (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/06\/20\/fashion\/20diaryspan-1\/20diaryspan-1-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/06\/20\/fashion\/20diaryspan-1\/20diaryspan-1-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/06\/20\/fashion\/20diaryspan-1\/20diaryspan-1-articleLarge.jpg","height":360,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/06\/20\/fashion\/20diaryspan-1\/20diaryspan-1-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":360},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Florence Reasserts Itself As a Fashion City-State","kicker":"FASHION DIARY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FLORENCE (ITALY)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEN AND BOYS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARTIES (SOCIAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-06-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Guy","lastname":"TREBAY"}],"original":"By GUY TREBAY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd281d28eb7c8105d84e696","word_count":1121},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B02EFDF1630F934A35752C1A9669D8B63","snippet":"The exuberance of autumn in New York was everywhere last week.
