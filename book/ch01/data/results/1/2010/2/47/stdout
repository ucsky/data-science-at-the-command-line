Sure, the drag-punk party Squeezbox faded in 2001, and the still-sizzling Misshapes departed in 2007. But last month the dingy club got a reprieve, thanks to Paul Sevigny and Nur Khan, the nightlife gurus who made their name with the Beatrice Inn. Their formula -- no bottle service, a draconian door policy, an illicit air -- hasn't faltered yet. The recent Fashion Week saw a flurry of celebrity-packed parties. And the ''Nur Khan Sessions,'' which featured intimate live shows by Courtney Love and others, are being held sporadically. But not all the ghosts have been exorcized. On a recent Friday night, the club's namesake, Don Hill, peered out from a booth, his gaunt face wreathed by long gray hair.","abstract":"Boite column visits Don Hill's, Greenwich Village nightclub; photo (M)","print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/10\/07\/fashion\/07BOITE\/Z-BOITE-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/10\/07\/fashion\/07BOITE\/Z-BOITE-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Don Hill's: SoHo","kicker":"Bo\u00eete"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"HILL, DON"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREENWICH (CONN)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DON HILL'S"},{"name":"subject","value":"NIGHTCLUBS AND CABARETS"}],"pub_date":"2010-10-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ben","lastname":"DETRICK"}],"original":"By BEN DETRICK"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd29c728eb7c8105d87de74","word_count":373},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/14\/photos-of-the-moment-marc-jacobs-3\/","snippet":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Bryan Bedder.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Bryan Bedder for Getty Images.","abstract":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Bryan Bedder.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photos of the Moment | Marc Jacobs","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-14T11:13:16Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Bryan","middlename":"Bedder","lastname":"GETTY","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By BRYAN BEDDER\/GETTY IMAGES"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39cb78eb7c8105d8dd12f","word_count":25},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/10\/13\/sports\/football\/13nfl.html","snippet":"Commissioner Roger Goodell would not provide a timetable Tuesday for completing an investigation into allegations against Brett Favre.","lead_paragraph":"CHICAGO -- Commissioner Roger Goodell would not provide a timetable Tuesday for completing an investigation into allegations against Brett Favre.
