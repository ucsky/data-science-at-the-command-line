Now,\u00a0in Scandinavia, another wunderkind is giving grown-up journalists a run for their money. The 15-year-old Danish blogger Nicklas Skovgaard's site documents his fashion fixations and aspirations from a small village near Copenhagen. His take on fashion shows and customized garments, as well as his emo-style self-portraits, have won him a local cult following.","abstract":"In Scandinavia, another wunderkind is giving fashion journalists a run for their money.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The (Teen) Insider | Nicklas Skovgaard","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-04-05T16:30:50Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Ana","middlename":"Finel","lastname":"HONIGMAN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By ANA FINEL HONIGMAN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39ad88eb7c8105d8d89ee","word_count":476},{"web_url":"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2010\/03\/30\/ungaro-owner-said-to-hold-talks-with-italian-scion\/","snippet":"The owner of Emanuel Ungaro, the French fashion label suffering under a load of debt, recently held deal talks with Matteo Marzotto, an Italian tycoon, The New York Post reported.","lead_paragraph":"The owner of Emanuel Ungaro, the French fashion label suffering under a load of debt, recently held deal talks with Matteo Marzotto, an Italian financier, The New York Post reported.","abstract":"The owner of Emanuel Ungaro, the French fashion label suffering under a load of debt, recently held deal talks with Matteo Marzotto, an Italian tycoon, The New York Post reported.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Ungaro Owner Said to Hold Talks With Italian Financier","kicker":"DealBook"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"},{"rank":"2","name":"persons","value":"Ungaro, Emanuel"}],"pub_date":"2010-03-30T06:39:26Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Business Day","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By DEALBOOK"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39a0d8eb7c8105d8d6d05","word_count":188},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/07\/25\/magazine\/25bounce-t.html","snippet":"The fast and profane music known as sissy bounce creates an atmosphere of sexual liberation \u2014 for women.","lead_paragraph":"If ''gay rapper'' is an oxymoron where you come from, how to get your head around the notion of a gay rapper performing in a sports bar? What in most cities might seem plausible only as some sort of Sacha Baron Cohen-style provocation is just another weeknight in the cultural Galapagos that is New Orleans. Sometime after midnight on the sweltering Thursday before Memorial Day, the giant plasma-screen TVs at the Sports Vue bar (which ''proudly airs all major Pay Per View events from the world of Boxing and Ultimate Fighting'') were all switched off, and the bar's backroom turned into a low-lit, low-ceilinged dance club, where more than 300 people awaited a return engagement by Big Freedia, who by day runs an interior-decoration business and who is, to fans of the New Orleans variant of hip-hop music known as ''bounce,'' a superstar. At 1 a.m., though, Freedia (pronounced ''FREE-da'') was still a mile or so away, fulfilling a paid celebrity-hosting gig at Club Fabulous. The fabulousness of Club Fabulous, on this night at least, seemed a function mainly of its Mardi Gras-themed d\u00e9cor, conceived and executed by Freedia herself. Otherwise the crowd was sparse, largely straight and listless. Freedia looked weary as she leaned back against the bar with her dyed, diagonally cut bangs over one eye, holding a cordless microphone. (Freedia, who is about 6 foot 2 and very powerful-looking and dresses in a fashionable but recognizably masculine style, is genetically a man; but neither she nor anyone who knows her uses masculine pronouns to refer to her.) When ''Rock Around the Clock,'' one of her signature songs, came on the sound system, a few women walked over to Freedia and stood with their backs to her, but the atmosphere wasn't quite electric enough for them to really start dancing, and the men just continued playing pool. After a while, Freedia's D.J. and de facto manager, who goes by the name Rusty Lazer -- a whippetlike 39-year-old white man with a salt-and-pepper beard -- let Freedia know that it was time to move on to the next show.","abstract":"Jonathan Dee article explores new genre of rap called 'sissy bounce,' performed by gay and transgender rappers in New Orleans; photos (M)","print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/07\/25\/magazine\/25bounce-span\/25bounce-t_CA3-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/07\/25\/magazine\/25bounce-span\/25bounce-t_CA3-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/07\/25\/magazine\/25bounce-span\/25bounce-t_CA3-articleLarge.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/07\/25\/magazine\/25bounce-span\/25bounce-t_CA3-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Neither Straight Nor Outta Compton"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW ORLEANS (LA)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRANSSEXUALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"RAP MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOMOSEXUALITY"}],"pub_date":"2010-07-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jonathan","lastname":"DEE"}],"original":"By JONATHAN DEE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29aa48eb7c8105d87a155","word_count":4669},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/05\/07\/arts\/design\/07antiques.html","snippet":"At her Versailles-inspired Newport home, she filled an 1890s Gothic reception room with pinnacled oak paneling, statues of saints and Roman cameos made of amethyst and carnelian.","lead_paragraph":"Alva Smith Vanderbilt Belmont, an impulsive and imperious railroad heiress, defied convention in the 1890s by dumping her unfaithful husband and running off with a neighbor.

At her Versailles-inspired Newport home, called Marble House (it contains 500,000 cubic feet of marble), she filled an 1890s Gothic reception room with pinnacled oak paneling, medieval stained glass, statues of saints, rock crystal watches and Roman cameos made of amethyst and carnelian. Much of the room's contents, which she tired of and sold for $125,000 in 1927, has been reunited for an exhibition that opens on Saturday at Marble House. The show's cumbersome title, ''Gothic Art in the Gilded Age: Medieval and Renaissance Treasures in the Gavet-Ringling-Vanderbilt Collection,'' refers to Mrs. Belmont's favorite Paris dealer, \u00c9mile Gavet, and her 1920s buyer, the circus tycoon John Ringling.","abstract":"Eve Kahn Antiques column; exhibition of antiques and other items collected by Alva Smith Vanderbilt, much of it on loan from Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Fla, will open at late railroad heiress's Marble House in Newport, RI; New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts is preparing to open its annual Scrimshaw Weekend, which will focus on myths, fakes and forgeries; Sotheby's will auction much of contents of studio of Surrealist artist Enrico Donati, including his collection of American and other tribal art; Colonial Williamsburg has hired Mamie Gummer, daughter of Meryl Streep, to perform as Lady Dunmore, wife of Virginia's last British governor, in authentic 18th-century costume made by its seamstresses; photo (M)","print_page":"29","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Stuff She Collected, Gilded and Not","kicker":"ANTIQUES"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"DONATI, ENRICO"},{"name":"persons","value":"GUMMER, MAMIE"},{"name":"persons","value":"VANDERBILT, ALVA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"WILLIAMSBURG (VA)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"PRESERVATION SOCIETY OF NEWPORT COUNTY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG FOUNDATION"},{"name":"organizations","value":"NEW BEDFORD WHALING MUSEUM"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SOTHEBY'S"},{"name":"organizations","value":"RINGLING MUSEUM OF ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"COLLECTORS AND COLLECTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NATIVE AMERICANS"},{"name":"subject","value":"HISTORIC BUILDINGS AND SITES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MYTHS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ANTIQUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"SCRIMSHAW"},{"name":"subject","value":"COSTUMES, THEATRICAL"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"MARBLE HOUSE (NEWPORT, RI)"}],"pub_date":"2010-05-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Science; Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By EVE M.
