(TCM) TCM REMEMBERS PATRICIA NEALShe was born Patsy Lou Neal in 1926 in a Kentucky coal-mining town and at the age of 10 wrote a letter to Santa Claus that said, ''What I want for Christmas is to study dramatics.'' By 21 she had won a Tony for her Broadway debut in the Lillian Hellman play ''Another Part of the Forest.'' At 39, a year after capturing the best actress Oscar for her performance as a shopworn housekeeper who resists Paul Newman's charm in the 1963 movie ''Hud,'' she had a series of strokes that put her into a coma for three weeks and left her semiparalyzed and unable to speak. Her husband, the British writer Roald Dahl, oversaw her recovery, and she returned to the screen in 1968, earning her second Academy Award nomination as the bitter mother in ''The Subject Was Roses,'' adapted by Ulu Grosbard from Frank Gilroy's play. That film is one of five that pay tribute to Neal, who died at 84 on Aug. 8. The evening begins with ''Private Screenings: Patricia Neal'' (2004), in which she discusses her career with Robert Osborne, and continues at 9 with ''The Fountainhead'' (1949), King Vidor's adaptation of the Ayn Rand novel, with Gary Cooper as an idealistic architect who refuses to compromise his vision and Neal (above with Cooper) as the woman he loves. At 1 a.m. Neal appears in ''A Face in the Crowd'' (1957) as a television executive who turns a folk-singing drifter (Andy Griffith) into a media darling. The salute ends with ''In Harm's Way'' (1965), at 3:15, with Neal as a Navy lieutenant alongside John Wayne's aging captain, who is assigned to a desk job after a botched mission against the Japanese. 8 P.M. (CW) 90210 A major earthquake rattles Beverly Hills in the Season 3 premiere, which picks up as Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord) deals with the aftermath of her rape. The Season 4 opener of ''Gossip Girl,'' at 9, finds Blair (Leighton Meester) and Serena (Blake Lively) reveling in the Parisian summer and banishing thoughts of New York boys from their pretty little minds -- until Blair spies Chuck (Ed Westwick).","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2010-09-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kathryn","lastname":"SHATTUCK"}],"original":"By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"4fd2a84a8eb7c8105d892617","word_count":800},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/10\/28\/fashion\/28upclose.html","snippet":"Cobi Levy, whose latest project, a SoHo restaurant called Niko, is scheduled to open soon, is trading exclusivity for inclusiveness.","lead_paragraph":"WHEN Cobi Levy showed up at the Boom Boom Room on a recent Wednesday night, he didn't have to worry about velvet ropes or door policies.

Moments later, a waitress in a Jetsons-esque minidress leaned over to take his drink order. ''Belvedere rocks?'' she asked. Mr. Levy (above) nodded in approval. ''There's not a better feeling in the world,'' he said.
