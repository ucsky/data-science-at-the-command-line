There are titles to treasure and those to avoid among the 27 features and 11 shorts, many of which have been cherry-picked and rather less discriminately culled from other festivals, including Cannes and Berlin. Among the bigger draws is the price of admission: if you're a member of either institution, you can nibble or binge at $10 a pop (but you'll have to smuggle your popcorn past the guards at the Modern). Given how New Directors covers the world -- the filmmakers in the 2010 edition have tramped on five of the continents -- it seems fitting that the opening-night (and nearly sold-out) selection centers on Bill Cunningham, the peripatetic street-and-society photographer whose pictorials are the first thing many turn to in The New York Times on Sunday. Aptly titled ''Bill Cunningham New York,'' the documentary is something of an inside job, having been produced by Philip Gefter, a former picture editor for the paper, and directed by Mr. Gefter's husband, Richard Press. The Times even shares the copyright, which might have made the whole thing insufferably cozy if not for the wonderfully liberated Mr. Cunningham.","abstract":"Manohla Dargis column on this year's Film Society of Lincoln Center and Museum of Modern Art's New Directors\/New Films series, which runs from March 24 through April 4; photos (M)","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"What's New","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/03\/24\/movies\/20100324-ndnf_index.html","rank":"1","height":700,"credit":"A look at some of the films featured in the first week of the New Directors\/New Films festival.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"700","MultimediaType1":"Slideshow","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"750","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/03\/24\/movies\/20100324-ndnf_index.html","MultimediaSummary1":"A look at some of the films featured in the first week of the New Directors\/New Films festival.","MultimediaHeadline1":"What's New"},"type":"Slideshow","width":750},{"url":"images\/2010\/03\/24\/movies\/24directorsspan\/24directorsspan-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/03\/24\/movies\/24directorsspan\/24directorsspan-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/03\/24\/movies\/24directorsspan\/24directorsspan-articleLarge.jpg","height":315,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/03\/24\/movies\/24directorsspan\/24directorsspan-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":315},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"At the New Directors\/New Films Festival, Seriousness Often Means Sadness","kicker":"FILM"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CUNNINGHAM, BILL"},{"name":"persons","value":"PRESS, RICHARD"},{"name":"persons","value":"MENDELSOHN, ERIC"},{"name":"persons","value":"GEFTER, PHILIP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MUSEUM OF MODERN ART"},{"name":"organizations","value":"FILM SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW DIRECTORS-NEW FILMS (FESTIVAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW DIRECTORS\/NEW FILMS (FESTIVAL)"}],"pub_date":"2010-03-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Manohla","lastname":"DARGIS"}],"original":"By MANOHLA DARGIS"},"type_of_material":"Series","_id":"4fd27bea8eb7c8105d841efc","word_count":1435},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/04\/14\/color-and-the-city\/","snippet":"One of the biggest trends in stores and magazines this spring is the mixed print - stripes mixed with animals prints, paisley with polka dots, and other colorful blends.
