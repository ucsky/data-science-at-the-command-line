The supermodel is planning a series of fashion shows to benefit the victims of the Haitian earthquake, including one during New York Fashion Week on Feb. 12. She has been rounding up looks from fashion designers to be worn by celebrities at the runway event and then auctioned to raise more funds.

The brand, founded in 1994, was conceived by an unsung cadre of 12 students largely inspired by the club-wear of the late '80s and '90s. Today a design team still toils anonymously to turn out a line destined to be worn in churning urban centers like Shanghai, Tokyo and Paris, where JNBY has, or soon will have, retail outlets.","abstract":"Ruth La Ferla reviews Soho boutique JNBY, which specializes in convertible clothing; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/06\/24\/fashion\/Z-CRITIC-A\/Z-CRITIC-A-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/06\/24\/fashion\/Z-CRITIC-A\/Z-CRITIC-A-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/06\/24\/fashion\/Z-CRITIC-A\/Z-CRITIC-A-articleLarge.jpg","height":330,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/06\/24\/fashion\/Z-CRITIC-A\/Z-CRITIC-A-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":330},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Shape Shifters That Mutate With You","kicker":"CRITICAL SHOPPER | JNBY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"JNBY"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOPPING AND RETAIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27cf98eb7c8105d844483","word_count":981},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/05\/27\/fashion\/27MAXI.html","snippet":"Among a new generation, long, lean and willowy dresses are gaining traction on Manhattan streets.","lead_paragraph":"JEAN RHYS knew a thing or two about style and, in particular, about the hauteur conveyed by the sweep of a hem. In her novel ''Wide Sargasso Sea,'' a Goth-tinged prequel to ''Jane Eyre,'' Christophine, a servant, lets the tail of her skirt fan out behind her -- a gesture of breeding, the reader is told. Hitching up one's hem, on the other hand, sends quite a different message. When your man is abusive, Christophine advises her young Creole mistress, just ''pick up your skirt and walk out.'' Today those gestures seem quaint -- more likely to be witnessed on Turner Classic Movies than on the F train or in fashion's front row. As for the style -- long, lean and willowy -- it is fast gaining traction on Manhattan streets as a new generation of early adopters discovers the attractions of a trailing hem.","abstract":"Among a new generation, long, lean and willowy dresses are gaining traction on Manhattan streets; look replaces all-to-familiar mini; photos (L)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/05\/27\/fashion\/27maxi-span\/27maxi-span-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/05\/27\/fashion\/27maxi-span\/27maxi-span-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/05\/27\/fashion\/27maxi-span\/27maxi-span-articleLarge.jpg","height":330,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/05\/27\/fashion\/27maxi-span\/27maxi-span-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":330},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"A Long, Lean Backlash To the Mini"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"DRESSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-05-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27e288eb7c8105d846e2e","word_count":1098},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/01\/06\/nyregion\/06about.html","snippet":"It is winter, a third of the city is poor, and unworn clothing is being destroyed nightly.","lead_paragraph":"In the bitter cold on Monday night, a man and woman picked apart a pyramid of clear trash bags, the discards of the HM clothing store that reigns in blazing plate-glass glory on 34th Street, just east of Sixth Avenue in Manhattan.
