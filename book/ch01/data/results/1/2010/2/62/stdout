On Monday the beleaguered Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles named as its new director Jeffrey Deitch, a prominent New York art dealer. This comes less than a week after Bill Moggridge, a prominent industrial designer and businessman, became the first design practitioner to head the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York -- an institution thought by many to lack vision. The Deitch news has of course overshadowed the Moggridge news in the art world, but the appointees are similar in many ways. Both lack experience in museum administration but have plenty of hands-on, real-world experience running businesses, collaborating with other practitioners and making creative things happen in the fields their museums focus on. Each appointment confirms that the other is not an anomaly, and together they represent a kind of wake-up call for museums in general. They point to a return to basics in American museum culture.","abstract":"Appointment of art dealer and gallery owner Jeffrey Deitch to head Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles is move calculated to revive foundering museum's image and energy; while lacking museum administration experience, Deitch has extensive experience running businesses, writing criticism and working with artists and is representative of new direction in museum directors; photo (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/01\/12\/arts\/12muse_CA0\/popup.jpg","height":400,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/01\/12\/arts\/12muse_CA0\/popup.jpg","xlargeheight":400},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"A New Boss, and a Jolt Of Real-World Expertise","kicker":"ART"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"DEITCH, JEFFREY"},{"name":"persons","value":"MOGGRIDGE, BILL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LOS ANGELES (CALIF)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DEITCH PROJECTS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART"},{"name":"organizations","value":"LOS ANGELES MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSEUMS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2010-01-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Roberta","lastname":"SMITH"}],"original":"By ROBERTA SMITH"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd276ae8eb7c8105d837970","word_count":1045},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/08\/08\/realestate\/08habitat.html","snippet":"Lisa Spellman, the owner of an art gallery, lives in a town house on Charlton Street that appears in Oliver Stone\u2019s upcoming sequel to \u201cWall Street.\u201d","lead_paragraph":"IF ever a building threaded itself into the hallowed history of New York City, it is the red brick town house at 41 Charlton Street, framed by lustrous wrought-iron railings topped with little pineapples, a symbol of hospitality.
