I've been a fan of the main Hermes site, but this is a clever addition for a house that is known for silk scarves and derives a lot of revenue from them. Hermes focuses on young women in Paris, London, New York and Tokyo, offers brief bio sketches and then shows how they wear scarves - which are having a comeback. The photographs are a cut above street-fashion images, and yet not as glossy-perfect as those found in magazines. Remember how fuddy-duddy scarf-tying demonstrations used to be? Remember when people knotted a Hermes scarf on the strap of their bag? Well, here is how a luxury-goods company can make the connection between its heritage (and ultimately sales) and street-style sites. Some of you will recall Burberry's The Art of the Trench site, which shows images of people in their trench coats. But I think there's a little more value in the information contained in jaimemoncarre.com. It feels new. And arguably there are more ways to wear a scarf than a trench.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn On The Runway column describes jaimemoncarre.com, new Web site that showcases different ways people wear Hermes scarves; photo (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Herm\u00e8s at Street Level","kicker":"ON THE RUNWAY"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"HERMES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"JAIMEMONCARRE.COM"},{"name":"subject","value":"SCARVES"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-08-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd282ab8eb7c8105d8503fa","word_count":375},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9400EFD91F30F93AA35756C0A9669D8B63","snippet":"EVEN with the Red Sox beanie  pulled over the trademark mane of black hair, it's not hard to spot Sarah Silverman in the lobby at the Bowery Hotel: she's the grown woman dressed like a 14-year-old boy.
