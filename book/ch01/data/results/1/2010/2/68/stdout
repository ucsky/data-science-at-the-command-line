(Sundance) FULL FRONTAL FASHION In its latest tribute to New York Fashion Week, the Sundance Channel offers six nights of sartorial-theme programming, as well as a new online magazine, FullFrontalFashion.com. Stepping off: Diane von Furstenberg, above, in the first of six new episodes of ''The Day Before,'' a documentary series from the director Lo\u00efc Prigent (''Sign\u00e9 Chanel'' and ''Marc Jacobs & Louis Vuitton'') that follows final preparations for runway presentations by high-profile fashion houses. Some are more relaxed than others. With only 36 hours until she presents her collection, Ms. von Furstenberg plays with her grandchildren as she figures out the V.I.P. seating chart, practices yoga while fitting models and intones the mantra ''Be proud to be you!'' Other episodes go behind the scenes with Versace (Thursday), Alexander Wang (Friday), Narciso Rodriguez (Saturday), Nina Ricci (Sunday) and Jeremy Scott (Monday). In ''Girl on the Run: Winter 2011,'' at 10:30, Mademoiselle Agn\u00e8s, the French fashion commentator, high-tails it from Chanel and C\u00e9line to Manish Arora and Olympia Le-Tan at the Paris collections while offering her take on Anna Wintour, Carine Roitfeld and the mysterious codes of leg-crossing in the front row. 8 P.M. (CW) AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL The theme of this 15th cycle is high fashion, and the winner's spoils include a photo spread in Italian Vogue. The competition begins as 32 contestants converge in Palm Springs, Calif., where all but 14 will be hastily eliminated. Then it's off to a party hosted by the designer Cynthia Rowley, the first in a crop of fashion types -- among them, Diane von Furstenberg, Zac Posen, Roberto Cavalli, Patrick Demarchelier, Patricia Field, Karolina Kurkova and Margherita Missoni -- to grace the season. Tyra Banks, Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley and Nigel Barker resume judging duties.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2010-09-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kathryn","lastname":"SHATTUCK"}],"original":"By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"4fd282a68eb7c8105d84ff66","word_count":775},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/03\/02\/scorecard-dolce-gabbana-wins-2\/","snippet":"Another day of runway looks, another Scorecard at your service.","lead_paragraph":"Remember that \"heritage\" buzzword Scorecard reported on from the Milan men's-wear shows?
