It's a remarkable find, but hardly a first for New York. Since the late 1970s, hundreds of archaeological digs around the city have uncovered thousands of artifacts and structures -- each of which have helped to shape our understanding of New York's history. The Op-Ed editors asked 12 local archaeologists to share their most memorable discoveries. Tannery Foley Square Maps show that in the 18th century the Collect Pond, which sat on the north side of Foley Square but was filled in around 1815, was home to the city's tanning industry -- but there were no artifacts to prove it. In 1995, though, I determined that subtle changes in the soil composition under the square were probably caused by rotted bark and organic mats, items that were used in the tanning process. Subsequent excavations yielded goat horns from discarded carcasses and tanning hooks, evidence that tanneries had in fact been on the site. -- JOSEPH SCHULDENREIN, archaeological consultant","abstract":"Op-Chart references discovery of 18th-century ship hull buried at World Trade Center site in noting that since late 1970s, hundreds of archaeological digs around New York City have uncovered thousands of artifacts and structures that have helped shape understanding of New York's history; 12 local archaeologists share their most memorable discoveries; drawing (M)","print_page":"27","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Raiders of the Lost City"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MATTHEWS, CHRISTOPHER"},{"name":"persons","value":"HERBSTER, HOLLY"},{"name":"persons","value":"JANOWITZ, META F"},{"name":"persons","value":"GEISMAR, JOAN H"},{"name":"persons","value":"STONE, LINDA"},{"name":"persons","value":"SCHULDENREIN, JOSEPH"},{"name":"persons","value":"CANTWELL, ANNE-MARIE"},{"name":"persons","value":"PICKMAN, ARNOLD"},{"name":"persons","value":"BERGOFFEN, CELIA"},{"name":"persons","value":"ROTHSCHILD, NAN A"},{"name":"persons","value":"SAUNDERS, CECE"},{"name":"persons","value":"LOORYA, ALYSSA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD TRADE CENTER (NYC)"}],"pub_date":"2010-07-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd29e9e8eb7c8105d88119f","word_count":862},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/18\/nyregion\/18mineo.html","snippet":"Before the jury got the case, a prosecutor demonstrated in court how quickly an attack on Michael Mineo could have occurred.","lead_paragraph":"The prosecutor grabbed a baton, the symbol of the police brutality case that has unfolded over the past month in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, to show how quickly Michael Mineo could have been sodomized, as he said he was in the Prospect Park subway station on Oct. 15, 2008.
