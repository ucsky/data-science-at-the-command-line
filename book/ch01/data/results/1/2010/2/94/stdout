For decades, the debate about balancing work and family life has been framed as an issue for women. Many studies have shown that motherhood is more taxing than fatherhood; mothers typically reported higher levels of unhappiness than women without children or men in general. Over the years, this disparity has helped fuel the gender wars, in policy debates and at home, often over a pile of dirty laundry.","abstract":"New studies show that fathers are struggling just as much--and sometimes more--than mothers in trying to fulfill their responsibilities at home and in office; drawing (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/06\/20\/weekinreview\/POPEcov\/POPEcov-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/06\/20\/weekinreview\/POPEcov\/POPEcov-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Now, Dad Feels as Stressed as Mom"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"PARENTING"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEN AND BOYS"},{"name":"subject","value":"HAPPINESS"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESEARCH"},{"name":"subject","value":"FATHER'S DAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"FAMILIES AND FAMILY LIFE"}],"pub_date":"2010-06-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Tara","lastname":"PARKER-POPE"}],"original":"By TARA PARKER-POPE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a7f88eb7c8105d891f83","word_count":980},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B01E2DF1431F937A35752C1A9669D8B63","snippet":"International     CHINA STAGES NAVAL DRILLS  ","lead_paragraph":"International CHINA STAGES NAVAL DRILLS","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Inside The Times"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2010-11-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Summary","_id":"4fd285558eb7c8105d8553ab","word_count":1040},{"web_url":"http:\/\/prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/01\/21\/many-obstacles-to-bipartisanship-as-health-legislation-evolved\/","snippet":"A series of developments conspired against the crafting of a bipartisan health care bill.","lead_paragraph":"In hindsight, it should probably come as little surprise to Democrats that voters in Massachusetts, a state with near-universal access to health insurance, would not feel all that motivated to rescue President Obama's efforts to provide universal benefits nationwide.","abstract":"A series of developments conspired against the crafting of a bipartisan health care bill.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Many Obstacles to Bipartisanship as Health Legislation Evolved","kicker":"Prescriptions"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-01-21T17:53:36Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Health","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By DAVID M.
