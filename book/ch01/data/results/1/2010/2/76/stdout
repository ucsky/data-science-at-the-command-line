As Scorecard can tell you, between men in gray flannel suits, international men of mystery and American gigolos, there was nary a decade this side of Technicolor that wasn't mined for inspiration in the closing shows. Yet as Famiglia Zegna proved, there's not much competition in the sport of archive digging when you're celebrating the centennial of the wool mill that Granddad founded.","abstract":"Today the men's-wear season gets underway in Paris, yet critics are somehow still filing their final reviews from Milan, so it's back to Italy for The Moment.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Scorecard | Ermenegildo Zegna Wins!","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-06-24T17:56:16Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Alison","middlename":"S.","lastname":"COHN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By ALISON S.

That overly familiar red-carpet question took on a bizarre resonance last weekend at Comic Con, a New York City convention for rabid devotees of comic books and graphic novels, film animation and video games.

(TV One) LISARAYE: THE REAL McCOY In 2006 LisaRaye McCoy (above right, with her daughter, Kai), went from American actress (she portrayed Neessee James on the CW sitcom ''All of Us'') to first lady when she married Michael Misick, the premier of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Suddenly her life was filled with mansions, private jets, servants and curtsies before the queen of England. And then -- after accusations that her husband was unfaithful, followed by a divorce -- it wasn't. This new reality series follows Ms. McCoy as she tries to re-establish her acting career and get her life back on track with assistance from 19-year-old Kai; her assistant, Quincy; and celebrities like Jamie Foxx, the Rev. Al Sharpton, Laila Ali, Tony Rock and Lil Jon. The reinvention begins as Ms. McCoy prepares to attend a fashion show and continues at 9:30 as she gets ready to walk the runway. In between, she sleuths for information on Kai's new boyfriend. 8 P.M. (Fox Business Network) STOSSELJohn Stossel explores libertarian beliefs about welfare, war, abortion, gay marriage and other issues. The political satirist P. J.
