BEHIND THE NEWS The trend back toward fur, an expensive material long shunned because of protests by animal-rights activists, seemed surprising in a recession. But fur breeders and furriers have been courting designers aggressively with samples, junkets and technical help for a decade, especially those too young to remember the peak of anti-fur activism in the 1980s and '90s.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ASCENDANT | MARCH 7-13"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2010-03-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a6968eb7c8105d88ef91","word_count":479},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/17\/movies\/17picture.html","snippet":"An autobiographical model\u2019s diary by Sara Ziff.","lead_paragraph":"''Picture Me'' seems surprised to learn that models are painfully thin, permanently tired (which tends to happen when you don't eat), relentlessly objectified and finally disposable. They fear the effortlessly skinny 12-year-olds jostling for their jobs and the predatory photographers who place them in what one model delicately terms ''compromising situations.'' And then there's all that walking. In this ''poor me, I was a supermodel; now I'm a Columbia student'' documentary, Sara Ziff, who began her career at the tender age of 14, records the highs and lows of her success. Over several years of footage shot by her co-director, Ole Schell, Ms. Ziff's callow narration (''Nothing comes that quickly or easily without a catch'') guides us through runway triumphs and a bathtub breakdown, girly dishing and teary confessions.","abstract":"Jeannette Catsoulis reviews documentary film Picture Me, directed by Ole Schell and Sara Ziff (M)","print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/09\/17\/arts\/17picture\/17picture-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/09\/17\/arts\/17picture\/17picture-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"A Model's Diary","kicker":"MOVIE REVIEW | 'PICTURE ME'"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"PICTURE ME (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"SCHELL, OLE"},{"name":"persons","value":"ZIFF, SARA"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jeannette","lastname":"CATSOULIS"}],"original":"By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd281d88eb7c8105d84eb40","word_count":362},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1DF153BF937A2575AC0A9669D8B63","snippet":"8 P.M.

(ESPN) UNMATCHED The main thing Chris Evert, above right, remembers about Martina Navratilova, above left, when they first faced each other as teenagers on the tennis court in 1973 was that her competitor was fat and sullen. ''She was very emotional on the court, whining if she didn't feel she was playing well,'' Ms. Evert said. ''But I remember thinking, if she loses weight, we're all in trouble.'' Her only goal that day, Ms. Navratilova countered, was for Ms. Evert ''to remember my name.'' Eighty matches later, the women had become not only competitors but also true friends. In this latest entry in the ''30 for 30'' documentary series, Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern Winters interview these tennis superstars to tell the story of one of the sport's greatest rivalries and to get their opinions on the state of the game. 6 A.M.

''Boomer & Carton,'' which replaced ''Imus in the Morning'' on WFAN, is now New York's top-rated morning show among men 25 to 54.

The news, which was quickly picked up by the Reuters financial blogger Felix Salmon, who subsequently sparked an online spat of his own with Mr. Blodget, did not break in a gossip column like The New York Post's Page Six or in the pages of The Wall Street Journal, which in a previous era might have owned this story.

In one typical example of mixed messages, the big reveal for the Fashion's Night Out Sept. 10 party lineup (celebrities and events galore at hundreds of stores staying open until 11 p.m.) appeared in an issue of Women's Wear Daily that was otherwise dedicated to a theme of fashion frugality.

During the week, it's where a group of particularly creative local residents work, in entertainment and design, and where many live, too, in the loft-style condo developments sprouting up by the day. King West feels like one of those glamorous, tourist-friendly neighborhoods that was once to be avoided, like the meatpacking district in New York. At the turn of the 20th century, King Street was a textile-manufacturing hub, but by the 1980s, many of the sturdy but humble brick buildings sat empty, so the city rezoned the land for mixed development. In the shells of those old factories, a destination neighborhood was born.

The ''interpretive Mediterranean'' menu includes beef carpaccio dumplings (15 Canadian dollars, about the same in U.S. dollars) and lobster wonton ravioli (24 dollars).
