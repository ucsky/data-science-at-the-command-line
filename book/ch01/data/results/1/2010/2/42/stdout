This cooperation between the ballet master Marius Petipa and Tchaikovsky has always been held up -- rightly -- as a yardstick (even though before the 1890 premiere Tchaikovsky by no means followed Petipa's requirements to the letter, and Petipa made small and large cuts in Tchaikovsky's music, giving up some of his own original ideas for the ballet). Compromises notwithstanding, theirs was a classic collaboration. In the theater to this day we seem to see and hear both choreography and music asking and answering each other's questions.","abstract":"Alastair Macaulay column on New York City Ballet and Pacific Northwest Ballet versions of classic The Sleeping Beauty, well-known collaboration between ballet master Marius Petipa and Tchaikovsky; photos (M)","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/02\/09\/arts\/09sleeping_CA0\/09sleeping_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/02\/09\/arts\/09sleeping_CA0\/09sleeping_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/02\/09\/arts\/09sleeping_CA0\/09sleeping_CA0-popup.jpg","height":450,"width":336,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":336,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/02\/09\/arts\/09sleeping_CA0\/09sleeping_CA0-popup.jpg","xlargeheight":450},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"2 Coasts and 2 Troupes: Contrasting Visions Of a Well-Trod Ballet","kicker":"DANCE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"HYND, RONALD"},{"name":"persons","value":"MARTINS, PETER"},{"name":"organizations","value":"NEW YORK CITY BALLET"},{"name":"organizations","value":"PACIFIC NORTHWEST BALLET"},{"name":"subject","value":"DANCING"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Alastair","lastname":"MACAULAY"}],"original":"By ALASTAIR MACAULAY"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd298108eb7c8105d8752b5","word_count":1286},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/15\/photos-of-the-moment-narciso-rodriguez-2\/","snippet":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Kevin Tachman.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Kevin Tachman.","abstract":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Kevin Tachman.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photos of the Moment | Narciso Rodriguez","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-15T14:17:50Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Kevin","rank":1,"lastname":"TACHMAN"}],"original":"By KEVIN TACHMAN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39c328eb7c8105d8dbbec","word_count":24},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/17\/photos-of-the-moment-calvin-klein-2\/","snippet":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Skye Parrott.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Skye Parrott.","abstract":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Skye Parrott.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photos of the Moment | Calvin Klein","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-17T11:48:04Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Skye","rank":1,"lastname":"PARROTT"}],"original":"By SKYE PARROTT"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39c2c8eb7c8105d8dba92","word_count":24},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/15\/photos-of-the-moment-sophie-theallet\/","snippet":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Kevin Tachman.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Kevin Tachman.","abstract":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Kevin Tachman.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photos of the Moment | Sophie Theallet","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-15T13:18:26Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Kevin","rank":1,"lastname":"TACHMAN"}],"original":"By KEVIN TACHMAN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39c7e8eb7c8105d8dc7f7","word_count":25},{"web_url":"http:\/\/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/13\/welcome-to-the-neighborhood\/","snippet":"The East Village Local blog -- a collaboration between N.Y.U. and The New York Times -- began today.","lead_paragraph":"City Room salutes the East Village Local blog, produced by the students and faculty of the Arthur L.
