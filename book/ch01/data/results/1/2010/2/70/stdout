This year's curatorial director is Kazuyo Sejima, principal of the Tokyo-based architecture firm SANAA, better known to most New Yorkers as the architect of the New Museum. Sejima is breaking new ground on many levels: not only is she the first woman to spearhead the Architecture Biennale, but her theme, \"People Meet in Architecture,\" is also refreshingly simple and easy to understand, for architects and laypeople alike (unlike titles of previous years, like \"Metamporh\" or \"Next\").","abstract":"The opening day of the Venice Architecture Biennale was a paradise for architecture groupies, with boldface names galore.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Architecture Biennale | Welcome to Venice","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-08-27T14:09:54Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Felix","rank":1,"lastname":"BURRICHTER"}],"original":"By FELIX BURRICHTER"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39c198eb7c8105d8db79e","word_count":487},{"web_url":"http:\/\/boss.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/05\/03\/healthcare-and-handbags-win-at-n-y-u-competition\/","snippet":"Two winners take home cash prizes of $75,000.","lead_paragraph":"The Stern School at New York University held the finals of its 11th annual business plan competition on Friday, with a cash prize of $75,000 for best new venture going to a \"fashion 2.0\" company, ToVieFor, which was co-founded by Melanie Moore and Susanne Greenfield.","abstract":"Two winners take home cash prizes of $75,000.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Health Care and Handbags Win at N.Y.U.
