This year, too, fashion played a co-starring role with music, as more than 1,300 performers descended on New York with distinctive looks that ranged from the oversize football jersey that Salem's Heather Marlatt casually donned for her opening night performance at Santos Party House (before a crowd that included art-house royalty like Ryan McGinley and Terence Koh) to the black leather bodysuit, adorned with white spikes, worn by Zowie's lead singer, Zoe Fleury (''My stegosaurus outfit,'' the New Zealander explained upstairs at Fat Baby), to the Nascar-styled jumpsuits worn by the Detroit duo, Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/10\/31\/fashion\/31cmj-span\/31cmj-span-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/10\/31\/fashion\/31cmj-span\/31cmj-span-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/10\/31\/fashion\/31cmj-span\/31cmj-span-articleLarge.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/10\/31\/fashion\/31cmj-span\/31cmj-span-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Was It the Music Marathon or Fashion Week?"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"CMJ MUSIC MARATHON"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"John","lastname":"ORTVED"}],"original":"By JOHN ORTVED"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd285548eb7c8105d855377","word_count":509},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/18\/fashion\/18MEN.html","snippet":"Reviews of the men\u2019s fashion collections from Calvin Klein, Michael Bastian and Thom Browne.","lead_paragraph":"When your name is Thom Browne, it might not be the best idea to use your initials as a logo.

''The shoes are right off the runway, this season,'' said the celebrity stylist Rosemary Ponzo, who, to demonstrate her longtime devotion to the venerated French label, had worn all of these things at the same time to the opening for the Chanel boutique in SoHo, newly renovated by Peter Marino.
