It did seem to make a return, in a variety of forms -- from the abundance of white fabrics, some of them sheer, to loose and often floor-sweeping skirts that had little detail. Minimalist designers, like Francisco Costa of Calvin Klein and Narciso Rodriguez, expressed themselves with greater precision. Mr. Costa's paneled dresses and coats seemed to hover between firm structure and airy volume. One thread in the minimalist discussion that intrigued me was a California influence. In his press notes, Derek Lam quoted passages from an art review earlier this year by Peter Schjeldahl about California minimalism. Mr. Schjeldahl said of the small art community in Los Angeles in the late '60s: ''They shared a serene sensuousness that couldn't have been more remote from New York's principled asperity.''","abstract":"Cathy Horyn On The Runway column notes that 1990s minimalist styles are latest trend found on runways during New York Fashion Week; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Minimalism, California Style","kicker":"ON THE RUNWAY"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a8568eb7c8105d892ef3","word_count":461},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/16\/fashion\/16FNO.html","snippet":"Fashion\u2019s Night Out attracted a well-dressed, younger clientele to streets and shops throughout New York City.","lead_paragraph":"STYLISH revelers may have flooded the stores and streets of New York on Sept. 10 for the second year of Fashion's Night Out, but for most shops the evening was more about brand building than racking up sales.
