She walks into Fig & Olive, an airy Manhattan restaurant, and exchanges cheek kisses with Bravo producers and cameramen. They tell Ms. Frankel, who had a baby just over two weeks earlier, how good she looks. Bravo and its new star then temporarily put reality on hold so they can film a reality show. Ms. Frankel stops chatting; she has been on ''The Real Housewives of New York City'' for three seasons and knows by now how to handle a scene. Without being told, she retreats to a glass foyer so she can be filmed as if she's entering the restaurant for the first time. Then she sits down, reintroduces a friend and an events planner who have already met off-camera, and doesn't flinch as two cameras zoom in for close-ups over her shoulder.","abstract":"Bravo reality TV cast members who inspire Internet buzz can get their own shows, like Bethenny Getting Married?, with Bethenny Frankel; Bravo studies its audience's lifestyle and preferences and then creates shows and stars that reflect them; cable network is aiming to minimize creative risks and maximize profits; photos (L)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/06\/06\/business\/BRAVO\/BRAVO-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/06\/06\/business\/BRAVO\/BRAVO-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/06\/06\/business\/BRAVO\/BRAVO-articleLarge.jpg","height":320,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/06\/06\/business\/BRAVO\/BRAVO-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":320},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"We'll Make You a Star (if the Web Agrees)"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"BETHENNY GETTING MARRIED?

Exhaustive self-promoters and occasional party crashers, they seemed ready to storm the offices of Cappellini or Moroso, demanding a shot at the big time. But if the big time has finally arrived for these 20-somethings, who introduced four products with four different companies in the past year, it's because they've earned it. By financing their own studio projects, they've been able to develop a colorful mix-and-match aesthetic that is both industrial and playful, one that has caught the eye of brands like SCP and Artecnica -- a rare feat for young American furniture designers. ''We've learned to know the difference between what will be a feather in your cap and what will actually help you build a business,'' says Williams (center). The group's Bright Side Lights for Artecnica, a cast-glass pendant inspired by old telephone-pole insulators and Mason jars, also happens to be its most mature effort to date. Says Richardson (right), ''We've started to develop our own voice.''
