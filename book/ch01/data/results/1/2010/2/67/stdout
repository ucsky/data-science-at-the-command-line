He's here to introduce his latest collection, the limited-edition Rendez-Vous. \"I wanted this collection to be more affordable than couture and more accessible in terms of design,\" says the designer, who played with a range of natural materials including wood, cord and horn. (Orders start in December and are limited to 10 per style.) New Yorkers will be the first to see the collection at a party tonight at Saks Fifth Avenue's shoe mecca, 10022, hosted by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, Lincoln Center's director of fashion. But this week isn't all business for Frisoni. He \"loves the old charm and the shabby chic suites,\" at the Carlyle Hotel and dining at the downtown bistro Da Silvano, \"for the Italian-like atmosphere and sunny terrace.\" Still, you never know when another bag or shoe idea will strike. His biggest inspiration, he says, \"comes from the graphic lines of the city and the crisp skies.\"","abstract":"The artistic director of Roger Vivier is in town to introduce his latest collection tonight at Saks Fifth Avenue.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Date with Bruno Frisoni","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-10-19T18:07:12Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"BARSAMIAN"}],"original":"By EDWARD BARSAMIAN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39d978eb7c8105d8df383","word_count":182},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/12\/30\/chic-in-review-beyonces-very-hermes-christmas\/","snippet":"All the fashion news that's fit to print.","lead_paragraph":"All the fashion news that's fit to print.","abstract":"All the fashion news that's fit to print.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chic in Review | Beyonc\u00e9's Very Herm\u00e8s Christmas","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-12-30T16:27:20Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Sarah","rank":1,"lastname":"LEON"}],"original":"By SARAH LEON"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39dd28eb7c8105d8dfbba","word_count":381},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/22\/scorecard-michael-kors-wins\/","snippet":"As the Tents folded on Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week for the very last time, the race was on for a new vision of pared-down American chic.","lead_paragraph":"As the Tents folded on Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week for the very last time, the race was on for a new vision of pared-down American chic.
