The fund sold a block of seven million shares at $8.13 a share for a total of about $57 million on Monday, according to a securities filing.

Here we were, underground, being moved from stack to stack by forces we couldn't fully understand, and had little hope of escaping from. It was like a scene from ''Metropolis,'' or ''Demolition Man,'' or ''The Mole People.'' Suddenly, though, a moment of corporate benevolence: Snuggled amid shirts with blocky stripes and filigree patterns was a plaid to make Steven Alan salivate. It was feather-light, ideal for summer, and its purple base was slashed through with yellow, black, ocean blue, orange and more, with a slightly faded quality that gave the impression of having lain out on the beach during one brutally sunny day.","abstract":"Jon Caramanica reviews Nordstrom Rack, discount retail men's wear outlet in Union Square; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/06\/17\/fashion\/17critic-span\/Z-CRITIC-A-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/06\/17\/fashion\/17critic-span\/Z-CRITIC-A-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/06\/17\/fashion\/17critic-span\/Z-CRITIC-A-articleLarge.jpg","height":360,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/06\/17\/fashion\/17critic-span\/Z-CRITIC-A-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":360},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Bargain Hunting Begins to Wear on You","kicker":"CRITICAL SHOPPER | NORDSTROM RACK"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"NORDSTROM INC"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOES AND BOOTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEN AND BOYS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOPPING AND RETAIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-06-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jon","lastname":"CARAMANICA"}],"original":"By JON CARAMANICA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29ea88eb7c8105d8816ec","word_count":1007},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/04\/02\/nyregion\/02nyc.html","snippet":"If a state senator\u2019s campaign to have young people pull up their trousers does not work, here is an alternative.","lead_paragraph":"Hector Quinones didn't amount to much in life, but he managed in death to make a powerful fashion statement.

On desks, chests, clocks and tables with massive curved feet, filigree brackets and inlaid anchor patterns, he wrote praise for Britain's naval victories and quelling of Irish rebels. ''Neptune Gave the Sea to England\/Now the World Must Obay,'' he once declared across a desk front. He also left behind personal notes.

(Sean Sweeney, the director of the SoHo Alliance, was quoted in The Villager describing those fans as ''a generation of classless, tasteless and clueless sheep.'')
