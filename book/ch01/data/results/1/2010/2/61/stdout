But no. On Monday night, Adam Rapoport was bouncing between a backyard grill covered with lamb chops and a bubbling potful of corn oil and French fries. Rashly (and graciously), he had agreed to feed dinner to a total stranger, under the merciless eyes of his 2-year-old son, his wife and a photographer. He seemed unafraid, a quality that will stand him in good stead in the high echelons of the magazine business, which he entered Monday as the head of Cond\u00e9 Nast's second-largest-circulation magazine. (The largest is Glamour.) Mr. Rapoport, 40 and for the last decade an editor at GQ magazine, may be in for a bumpy ride.","abstract":"Profile of Adam Rapoport, new editor in chief of Bon Appetit magazine; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/11\/03\/dining\/14kitchen-span\/14kitchen-span-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/11\/03\/dining\/14kitchen-span\/14kitchen-span-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/11\/03\/dining\/14kitchen-span\/14kitchen-span-articleLarge.jpg","height":315,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/11\/03\/dining\/14kitchen-span\/14kitchen-span-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":315},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"A New Flavor For Bon App\u00e9tit","kicker":"IN THE KITCHEN WITH | ADAM RAPOPORT"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"RAPOPORT, ADAM"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BON APPETIT"},{"name":"subject","value":"COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MAGAZINES"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOOD"}],"pub_date":"2010-11-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Dining In, Dining Out \/ Style Desk","section_name":"Dining and Wine; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Julia","lastname":"MOSKIN"}],"original":"By JULIA MOSKIN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2855a8eb7c8105d8558a2","word_count":1250},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/11\/17\/realestate\/commercial\/17bryant.html","snippet":"Shaken by the real estate crash, the Bryant Park office submarket has attracted buyers looking for real estate bargains.","lead_paragraph":"When the technical school Katharine Gibbs shut its doors last year at 50 West 40th Street, it appeared to be another blow for the tiny Bryant Park office submarket. The blocks that bracket the 9.6-acre park were already facing the partial departure of HSBC, a longtime anchor tenant; a largely vacant landmarked office tower; and the fire sale of a stalled development site. But there are bright spots: The City University of New York is awaiting final approvals for a 10-year lease to install its first new community college in more than 30 years at the 91,000-square-foot building that once housed Katharine Gibbs. The school is paying roughly $55 a square foot.

Strolling down Broadway, Mr. Faurer pointed out the sites of onetime attractions like the Planters store near 47th Street, which sold fresh-roasted peanuts; the Camel billboard at 44th Street that used to puff steam ''smoke rings'' over passers-by; Hubert's Dime Museum, home of a freak show and flea circus on 42nd Street, west of Seventh Avenue; and the strip of movie theaters that lined and lighted up that same block, where you could see B movies and first-run films at cut-rate prices. Mr. Faurer, 67, has come to know the city inside out in his 33 years as a cabby, but his memories of this long-gone version of Times Square go back even farther. His father, the photographer Louis Faurer, who died in 2001, was an ardent chronicler of New York street life in the 1940s and '50s, particularly in this neighborhood, and often took Mark on his rounds as a child. In the 1960s the elder Faurer sometimes asked his son to join him as he shot a silent film called ''Time Capsule,'' again mainly on the streets of Times Square.","abstract":null,"print_page":"25","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/04\/23\/arts\/23faurerspan-1\/23faurer_CA1-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/04\/23\/arts\/23faurerspan-1\/23faurer_CA1-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2010\/04\/23\/arts\/23faurerspan-1\/23faurer_CA1-articleLarge.jpg","height":395,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2010\/04\/23\/arts\/23faurerspan-1\/23faurer_CA1-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":395},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"The Streets, Frozen In Neon"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"TIMES SQUARE AND 42ND STREET (NYC)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PHOTOGRAPHY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2010-04-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Carol","lastname":"KINO"}],"original":"By CAROL KINO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b6c08eb7c8105d8ab15b","word_count":1697},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/15\/model-morphosis-diane-von-furstenberg\/","snippet":"The model Georgina Stojiljkovic gets transformed for the Diane von Furstenberg show.","lead_paragraph":"The photographer Greg Kessler captures the transformations of New York Fashion Week.
