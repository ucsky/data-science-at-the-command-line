Like Mr. Levine, Seiji Ozawa has had a series of ailments in recent years, including pneumonia, shingles, sciatica and, this year, cancer of the esophagus. He underwent major surgery in January and extensive therapy in its wake, and has had to cancel almost all of his engagements this year, including performances in Japan, concerts and tours with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic, and an appearance with the Boston Symphony at Tanglewood. But the Saito Kinen Festival in Matsumoto -- a city of some 225,000 nestled in the foothills of the Japanese Alps, less than an hour from Nagano, the site of the 1998 Winter Olympics -- was to be the scene of his triumphal return, his first public appearance on the podium since January.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/09\/07\/arts\/SEIJI\/SEIJI-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/09\/07\/arts\/SEIJI\/SEIJI-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"In Japan, a Frail Osawa Conducts Only One Tchaikovsky Movement","kicker":"MUSIC"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"OZAWA, SEIJI"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MATSUMOTO (JAPAN)"},{"name":"subject","value":"CLASSICAL MUSIC"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"James","middlename":"R.","lastname":"OESTREICH","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By JAMES R.

It did so through the 1970s; but as inertia took its toll, Lincoln Center installed Gerard Schwarz as music director, presumably hoping he would bring consistency to the festival orchestra's performances and freshen up its programs. That worked until Lincoln Center came up with the ill-conceived notion of commemorating the bicentenary of Mozart's death by playing every note of his music, and shunting some of the dullest works onto the 1992 Mostly Mozart schedule. Since then Mostly Mozart has reinvented itself several times. The stylish Mozartean Louis Langr\u00e9e spiffed up the orchestra when he was appointed music director in 2003, and in recent years Lincoln Center has offered a few special twists, like resident composers, commissioned works and semistagings of operas at the Rose Theater.","abstract":"Allan Kozinn reviews opening concert of Mostly Mozart Festival at Avery Fisher Hall; photo (M)","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"If It's Summer, It Must Be Mostly Mozart Time Again","kicker":"MUSIC REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL"}],"pub_date":"2010-07-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Allan","lastname":"KOZINN"}],"original":"By ALLAN KOZINN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd2b7378eb7c8105d8abcd4","word_count":679},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/06\/16\/business\/16views.html","snippet":"It makes sense that the BP disaster would weigh more heavily than the Greek debt crisis on stocks: it lays bare the limits of human capability.","lead_paragraph":"Forget Greece.
