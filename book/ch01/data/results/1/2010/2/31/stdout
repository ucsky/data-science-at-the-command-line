After a year of plummeting American sales, manufacturers were not in a position to showcase flashy new products or fancy exhibits. Most of the presentations at the media preview on Friday focused on products that had been revealed elsewhere. It was a distinct change from the 2009 show, when the industry had a previous-year sales boost to crow about and there were new models and concept bikes on display.","abstract":"After a year of plummeting American sales, manufacturers were not in a position to showcase flashy new products or fancy exhibits.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"No News Is Good News at the New York Motorcycle Show","kicker":"Wheels"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"},{"rank":"3","name":"subject","value":"New Models, Design and Products"},{"rank":"2","name":"subject","value":"Motorcycles, Motor Bikes and Motorscooters"}],"pub_date":"2010-01-22T16:28:11Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Autos","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Daniel","rank":1,"lastname":"MCDERMON"}],"original":"By DANIEL MCDERMON"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd399388eb7c8105d8d4d0a","word_count":547},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/10\/14\/fashion\/14pagesix.html","snippet":"Richard Johnson last week announced his departure from a column in The New York Post that he led for almost 25 years, leaving some to reflect on his influence.","lead_paragraph":"FEW newspaper columns survey the city's cultural skyline as panoramically as Page Six, The New York Post's marquee gossip page, which reports equally on the goings-on in downtown dive bars, corporate boardrooms and uptown penthouses.

And it is borne out in the eruptive nature of the music, with hushed passages of exotic colorations and expectant mystery repeatedly cast aside by brutal, pounding rhythms or savage, brassy whoops. This is a signature work of the conductor Valery Gergiev, who saved it for the final concerts of his three-week Stravinsky festival with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday and Saturday.
