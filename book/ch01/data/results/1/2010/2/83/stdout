A D.J. spins fusion jazz records nonstop and luminous personalities are always dropping by -- not just arty types but astrophysicists like Michio Kaku and Neil deGrasse Tyson. At 72, Max is still wowed by the cosmos. ''Guess how many galaxies there are?'' he asks, giddily. ''About 350 billion!'' You can see some of that stardust sprinkled on this issue's ''T'' logo (''Tripping Out,'' Page 101). Born in Germany, Max lived a peripatetic youth, with stops in China, Israel, France and Africa. He first heard bebop on the radio in Shanghai. ''I just thought it was Chinese music.''

Both the auction and the book reveal Hall's connoisseurship and her close relationships with distinguished artists. Best known as the supermodel who epitomized 1970s glamour, as the former wife of Mick Jagger and as an actress with a decade of treading the boards on Broadway and the West End, Hall is now bringing to the surface another role she has played since she arrived in Paris from Gonzales, Tex., at age 16 - the role of muse.","abstract":"Sotheby's London is selling artwork from Jerry Hall's personal collection; drawing (S)","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Multimedia Muse","kicker":"T MAGAZINE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"HALL, JERRY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SOTHEBY'S"},{"name":"subject","value":"AUCTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2010-10-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ben","lastname":"CRAWFORD"}],"original":"By BEN CRAWFORD"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29c728eb7c8105d87de6f","word_count":587},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/06\/21\/resort-scorecard-stella-mccartney-wins\/","snippet":"When reviewing collections intended expressly to lure the dollars of women who winter in the urban jungle, qualities like prettiness, wearableness and merchiness are suddenly very good things.","lead_paragraph":"When did resort become a fully fledged season (like those divisions of the year, spring and fall, that actually represent a change in weather)?
