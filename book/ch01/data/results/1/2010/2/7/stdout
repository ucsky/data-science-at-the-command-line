But for fall, designers elevated hoods, attaching them to cloaks, frocks and densely knitted sweaters, lending those items a luxurious gloss they haven't possessed since Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges issued square-cornered versions, an allusion to the space age, and Halston introduced his signature hooded cashmere capes.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Raising the Hood","kicker":"TRENDSPOTTING"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"Caption","_id":"4fd2b6738eb7c8105d8aa091","word_count":177},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/02\/17\/fashion\/20100217FIRSTLOOKBurch_FW_index.html","snippet":"Views from backstage at Tory Burch's Fall 2010 collection.","lead_paragraph":"Views from backstage at Tory Burch's Fall 2010 collection.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"First Look: Tory Burch "},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2010-02-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8c4a1c22dfde670c42c3","word_count":18},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/02\/16\/fashion\/20100216_FIRSTLOOKWang_FW_index.html","snippet":"Views from back stage at Vera Wang's Fall 2010 collection.","lead_paragraph":"Views from back stage at Vera Wang's Fall 2010 collection.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"First Look: Vera Wang "},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2010-02-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8c441c22dfde670c4234","word_count":19},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/02\/12\/fashion\/20100212SCENE_FW_index.html","snippet":"Scenes around the tents at Bryant Park and backstage during New York Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes around the tents at Bryant Park and backstage during New York Fashion Week.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Scene: Day Two "},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2010-02-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8c441c22dfde670c4225","word_count":23},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/16\/fashion\/16second.html","snippet":"Some observations from a first-time attendee at New York Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"Some observations from a first-time attendee at New York Fashion Week.","abstract":"Observations on the shows and designers from a first-time attendee at New York Fashion Week;
