But Anna Sui has a gift for mining fashion gold from her trips around the world, which makes her an ideal guest for a show like ''Man Shops Globe,'' the Sundance Channel series that follows Keith Johnson, the globe-trotting buyer at large for Anthropologie. For an episode on Aug. 18, Ms. Sui accompanied Mr. Johnson to Syria on a craft-finding mission, for which they toured the markets in Aleppo and Damascus for hand-carved soaps and glass chandeliers. ''My dream was Uzbekistan,'' Ms. Sui said, ''but it was too cold.'' She seems to have been cast for comic relief. Swathed in hot towels in a hamam, Ms. Sui observes, ''It's the original version of Snuggie.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Anything to Declare?
