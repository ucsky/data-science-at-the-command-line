Luckily, there were plenty of other distractions including a buzzing scene at the Feria de Madrid site and an array of eccentric bold-face names who could have walked out of an Almodovar film.Much of the excitement on the runways came courtesy of the top-tier models who skipped London, where few designers can afford to pay fees, in favor of Madrid. Iris Strubegger, Marina Peres, Eniko Mihalik, Egle Tvirbutaite, Denisa Dvorakova, Michaela Kocianova Diana Farkhullina, Daiane Conterato and Charlotte di Calypso added some \"super\" appeal to the calendar.","abstract":"Balenciaga's Nicolas Ghesquiere is currently one of the world's most influential designers, but when it comes to Spanish fashion, it's Cristobal Balenciaga who casts a long shadow.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Meanwhile, in Madrid ...","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2010-02-25T15:15:44Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Sameer","rank":1,"lastname":"REDDY"}],"original":"By SAMEER REDDY"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd399818eb7c8105d8d5812","word_count":510},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/03\/01\/the-insider-mike-nouveau\/","snippet":"The downtown D.J.
