Fashion, per se, is definitely not art; it is an elegant hybrid of craft and commerce to beautify the human body. But on rare occasions, the work of designers can be classified as a minor art form, especially when put together artfully by a wearer. Top row, guests at the shows who created tasteful and refined looks through their use of color and proportion. Bottom row, wearable art: a man wore a different suit om each day of the shows. He'd had them tailored from painter's canvas and then had an artist paint them after posters from the Belle \u00c9poque. In between these two extremes were many suggestions of fashion to come: full skirts, hot pants and the futuristic prints of the late Alexander McQueen. For many of the guests, the shows are a time to dress up; two were resplendent in their Native American turquoise and silver jewelry. The move of a third of the shows to Lincoln Center from Bryant Park proved a huge success with its luxury of space. Nearly 200 designers showed in other locations throughout the city.","abstract":"Bill Cunningham On The Street column describes styles worn by guests attending New York Fashion Week runway shows; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Views","kicker":"ON THE STREET"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2010-09-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"CUNNINGHAM"}],"original":"By BILL CUNNINGHAM"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29f158eb7c8105d882455","word_count":206},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/02\/16\/style\/20100216SCENE_index.html","snippet":"Scenes around the tents at Bryant Park and backstage during New York Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes around the tents at Bryant Park and backstage during New York Fashion Week.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Scene: Day Six "},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2010-02-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8c441c22dfde670c423e","word_count":23},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/02\/15\/fashion\/20100215SCENE_FW_index.html","snippet":"Scenes around the tents at Bryant Park and backstage during New York Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes around the tents at Bryant Park and backstage during New York Fashion Week.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Scene: Day Five "},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2010-02-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8c441c22dfde670c4235","word_count":23},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/02\/15\/style\/20100215_FIRSTLOOKHerrera_index.html","snippet":"Backstage views of Carolina Herrera's Fall 2010 collection at New York Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"Backstage views of Carolina Herrera's Fall 2010 collection at New York Fashion Week.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"First Look: Carolina Herrera "},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":"HERRERA, CAROLINA"},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2010-02-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8c4a1c22dfde670c42c2","word_count":24},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/13\/fashion\/13SMITH.html","snippet":"LaQuan Smith is that quintessential newcomer, driven, against daunting odds, to snatch the Fashion Week spotlight.","lead_paragraph":"LaQuan Smith has no studio, no eager assistants -- not even a super-strength sewing machine.

We knew it would be in the audience - that stripe-y tunic dress with zip shoulder (so Agn\u00e8s B and yet so not) is ubiquitous at Lincoln Center, as are the wide-leg pants, the khaki shirt with gold zipper pulls, the soft square tote. But how much of the C\u00e9line designer Phoebe Philo's tailored conceptualism, her hand with stripped-back superhot sportswear, would find its way into American clothes remained to be seen. We - fashion editors - all remember the Marni-fication of the industry a decade ago. We know very well what one cool brand can do to women's closets. And, let's face it: sportswear is the hallmark of American fashion.
