(13) BORIS GODUNOV The German bass Ren\u00e9 Pape, above, has the title role in the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Mussorgsky's work, based on a play by Alexander Pushkin, about the reign of the ruthless 16th- and 17th-century Russian czar. Stephen Wadsworth directed, taking over from Peter Stein, who quit three months before the October premiere; Valery Gergiev conducts. Reviewing ''Boris Godunov,'' presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met'' and running three and a half hours, Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times: ''This production comes to life through the nuanced and affecting performances of the cast and chorus. This is Mr. Wadsworth's doing, abetted, of course, by the vivid, gravely beautiful performance elicited by Mr. Gergiev.'' Still, Mr. Tommasini said: ''The production does not seem fully realized. How could it be? It is impossible to know what Mr. Wadsworth would have done had he been able to fashion a look and concept that conveyed his insights into the story as told by Mussorgsky.'' Mr. Pape, he wrote, not only looked regal and imposing but ''has vocal charisma as well, and his dark, penetrating voice is ideal for the role. Not knowing Russian, I cannot vouch for the idiomatic quality of his singing. But his enunciation was crisp and natural. And in every language Mr. Pape makes words matter.'' 8 P.M. (NBC) COMMUNITY It's Valentine's Day, and Troy (Donald Glover) and Abed (Danny Pudi) compete for the attention of the Greendale Community College librarian, while Britta (Gillian Jacobs) tries to get chummy with a student she thinks is a lesbian. In ''Perfect Couples,'' at 8:30, Julia (Christine Woods) is upset when Dave (Kyle Bornheimer) meets a woman while hiking; Rex (Hayes MacArthur) doesn't know how to tell Leigh (Olivia Munn) that he has financial difficulties; and Vance (David Walton) and Amy (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) prod each other into jealousy. In ''The Office,'' at 9, Michael (Steve Carell) and Holly (Amy Ryan) cause everyone to squirm with their public displays of affection. In ''Parks and Recreation,'' at 9:30, Tom (Aziz Ansari) plots revenge on Ron (Nick Offerman) by going on a date with Ron's ex-wife, Tammy (the guest star Megan Mullally). ''30 Rock,'' at 10, finds Jack (Alec Baldwin) and Avery (Elizabeth Banks) traveling to Canada for one last romantic getaway before the baby is born -- but scrambling back to New York so as not to give birth to a Canadian. Meanwhile Liz (Tina Fey) and Carol (Matt Damon) are stranded on the tarmac. And in ''Outsourced,'' at 10:30, Todd (Ben Rappaport) decides to give his employees anger management training.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-02-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kathryn","lastname":"SHATTUCK"}],"original":"By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"4fd289978eb7c8105d85b270","word_count":756},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/10\/14\/runaround-ruby\/","snippet":"She's young.

It's all about finding that thing in a person that ignites change.'' In this new makeover series, part of ''Full Frontal Fashion,'' the channel's annual programming tribute to New York Fashion Week, Mr. Sparo offers some sartorially lost souls ''design therapy'' in his East Village studio, where he helps his clients battle their inhibitions. His first subjects include Jennifer, a new mother who finds her postbaby curves too matronly; the six-foot-tall Nefe, who is sometimes mistaken for a man; and Tali, a showgirl and Mr. Sparo's secret crush, who needs a 10-piece ensemble for her Las Vegas act. 2 P.M.
