Its refusal to collect sales tax in California despite a new law compelling it to do so prompted some well-publicized criticism not only from politicians but the tech community. Its hiring of ambulances at its Pennsylvania warehouse to wait for workers to keel over in the summer heat conjured up a Dickensian sweatshop. The retailer apparently brought its Kindle Fire tablet to market before it had all the kinks out, disappointing some of its biggest fans.","abstract":"The key to Amazon's success over the years has been its relentlessness.

But business as usual can sometimes be its own quiet form of defiance. Despite Mr. Ai's absence, his plans for exhibiting his art in the West have been proceeding on schedule. Last weekend an exhibition of new work opened at the Neugerriemschneider Gallery in Berlin, which displayed an immense white banner printed in black with the words ''Where is Ai Weiwei'' on the front of its building. (It was designed by the artist Rirkrit Tiravanija.) A larger exhibition will open next week at the Lisson Gallery in London. And in Manhattan ''Circle of Animals\/Zodiac Heads,'' which is being termed Mr. Ai's first public sculpture, was proclaimed open on Wednesday morning in a drizzle at the Pulitzer Fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel.","abstract":"Roberta Smith reviews sculpture by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei at the Pulitzer Fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/05\/05\/arts\/WEI\/WEI-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/05\/05\/arts\/WEI\/WEI-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/05\/05\/arts\/WEI\/WEI-articleLarge.jpg","height":315,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/05\/05\/arts\/WEI\/WEI-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":315},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"12 Heads Do the Talking for a Silenced Artist","kicker":"ART REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"AI WEIWEI"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CHINA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MANHATTAN (NYC)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"PLAZA HOTEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2011-05-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Roberta","lastname":"SMITH"}],"original":"By ROBERTA SMITH"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd2b8c68eb7c8105d8aeb2a","word_count":949},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9D00E7D91E3DF933A15751C0A9679D8B63","snippet":"International     SAUDI ARABIA ISOLATED  ","lead_paragraph":"International SAUDI ARABIA ISOLATED","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Inside The Times"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-02-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2ab068eb7c8105d89712e","word_count":1370},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B03E6DF113EF93BA25755C0A9679D8B63","snippet":"International     IN TRIPOLI, CONSCRIPTS BEAR  ","lead_paragraph":"International IN TRIPOLI, CONSCRIPTS BEAR","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Inside The Times"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-06-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Summary","_id":"4fd2ac158eb7c8105d898d15","word_count":546},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/05\/03\/business\/media\/03adco.html","snippet":"Westin Hotels and Resorts enumerates the reasons to stay there so, as a top company executive puts it, guests leave feeling better than they did when they arrived.","lead_paragraph":"TRAVELERS are concerned about numbers like $4, as in the price of a gallon of gasoline in many parts of the country.
