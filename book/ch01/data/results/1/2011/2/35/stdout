Certainly the fresh use of houndstooth -- in sexy tailoring, in accessories -- by Massimiliano Giornetti, Ferragamo's creative director, has caught on. In Milan last week, Anna Dello Russo turned up in his wrap-front houndstooth dress. In New York, the model Jessica Hart wore the same style on Fashion's Night Out (left) and, later in the week, a Ferragamo blazer with denim shorts at a runway show (right). And he is scarcely the only designer to rediscover the classic check. Gwyneth Paltrow wore a Stella McCartney coat in London (far right), and Mia Wasikowska chose a Gucci houndstooth dress for the Toronto Film Festival. There are houndstooth pants at J. Crew for $138. Robert Rodriguez did a sensibly priced houndstooth cape ($695 at Bergdorf Goodman). And then there are the accessories: Ralph Lauren sunglasses (above), $250; Wolford tights, $65. Stripes and polka dots -- give it a rest.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Fashion Forward?

Originally published in W magazine from 1997 to 2008, the images are a remarkable record of a free-spirited period in publishing that seemed to end with the recession. They speak directly to the eye of Mr. diCorcia, with its capacity to excite and disturb, and to seek truth about human behavior in the most banal of scenes. The images were also a result of a fortuitous collaboration between Mr. diCorcia and Dennis Freedman, then the art director of W, who gave the artist carte blanche to shoot fashion stories in places like Havana, Cairo and New York. They have collected all 11 shoots in a new book, ''Eleven.'' Are they fashion stories? In a way, yes, though you rarely notice the clothes. They are really about a vacuum in the middle of contemporary life, of which fashion has been a key element. That is one interpretation anyway. I spoke to Mr. diCorcia (or P. L., as he is known) about the work then and now. Young artists should feel gratified when he says of the creative process: ''It's exactly what it's always been. It's just hard work.''","abstract":"Cathy Horyn On The Runway column on fashion photographer Philip-Lorca diCorcia; retrospective of his work is on view at David Zwirner Gallery and published in book Eleven; photo (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Focused Past Fashion","kicker":"ON THE RUNWAY"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"ELEVEN (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"DICORCIA, PHILIP-LORCA"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"PHOTOGRAPHY"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2913c8eb7c8105d869c05","word_count":630}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
