Crew staged its highly anticipated, first-ever New York Fashion Week presentation at the tents in Lincoln Center this season. The men's collection, designed by Frank Muytjens, included some greatest hits of American sportswear (the perfect slender suits and sports jackets, sailor-striped knits and tailored trousers) alongside clever pieces in bright colors, plaids and polka dots, always impeccably styled. The cuffed khakis lined with St. James stripes were absolutely charming, but my favorite look was on the more minimal side. A stone-colored jean jacket, buttoned all the way up and worn with matching jean-style trousers, topped by a navy nylon lightweight parka, was the winner for me. The jacket is from a new capsule collection called Wallace & Barnes that will consist of reinterpretations of favorite vintage pieces that somehow never made it into the main line.
