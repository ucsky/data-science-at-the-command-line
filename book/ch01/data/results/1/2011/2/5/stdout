Originally published in W magazine, between 1997 and 2008, the images are a remarkable record of a free-spirited period in publishing that seemed to come to an end with the recession and, as well, the Internet. They speak directly to the eye of Mr. diCorcia, with their capacity to excite and disturb, and to seek truth about human behavior in the most banal of scenes. These photographs were also the result of a fortuitous collaboration between Mr. diCorcia and Dennis Freedman, the former art director of W, who gave the artist carte blanche to shoot fashion stories in places like Havana, Cairo and New York. They have collected all 11 shoots in a new book, \"Eleven\" (Damiani Editions).","abstract":"On Thursday night, at the start of Fashion Week, several hundred people came to the David Zwirner Gallery to see an exhibition of Philip-Lorca diCorcia's photographs.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Q & A: Philip-Lorca diCorcia","kicker":"On the Runway"},"keywords":[{"rank":"4","name":"subject","value":"New York Fashion Week"},{"rank":"3","name":"subject","value":"Fashion and Apparel"},{"rank":"2","name":"persons","value":"Di Corcia, Philip-Lorca"},{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-11T10:44:28Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Cathy","rank":1,"lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39e828eb7c8105d8e14e8","word_count":1895},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/15\/calvin-klein-x-ray-vision\/","snippet":"The celebrities on the front row at Calvin Klein wore dresses in solid colors that looked covered up.

Then loads of Hairspray 23 on the loose hair, \"for texture, not hold,\" Palau said. \"Wet and dry, shine and matte,\" is how he described the contrasts within the style.

I like to bend the elbow in much the same way that, say, Richard Burton liked the odd whiskey. So it should surprise exactly no one that I am also fond of drinking games. My favorite involves having a sip every time a character on a reality-TV show says the word \"journey.\" (It's become such a cliche that unless you have Burton's constitution, I recommend a sip instead of a shot.) As far as games go, it's as elastic as a pair of Spanx and works equally well while watching the crimes against fabric on \"Project Runway\" or the unbeweavable hair don'ts on \"Hair Battle Spectacular.\" But real-life fashion people care more about instant gratification than the process.
