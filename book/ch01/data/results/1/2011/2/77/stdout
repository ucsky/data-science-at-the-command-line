Residents described a mobilization in the capital, Damascus, and, in more pronounced fashion, in the restive city of Homs, where a government crackdown this week dispersed one of the largest gatherings since demonstrations began last month. For days, organizers have looked to Friday as a potential show of strength for a movement that has yet to build the critical mass reached in Egypt and Tunisia.","abstract":"Syria deploys security forces in Damascus and Homs to prepare for protests that will test the popular reception of reforms decreed by Pres Bashar al-Assad and the momentum that organizers have sought for an uprising; photo (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/04\/22\/world\/22syria_cnd\/22syria_cnd-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/04\/22\/world\/22syria_cnd\/22syria_cnd-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/04\/22\/world\/22syria_cnd\/22syria_cnd-articleLarge.jpg","height":330,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/04\/22\/world\/22syria_cnd\/22syria_cnd-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":330},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Syrians Gearing Up For Protest, And a Test Of Wills"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ASSAD, BASHAR AL-"},{"name":"glocations","value":"HOMS (SYRIA)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SYRIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"DAMASCUS (SYRIA)"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEMONSTRATIONS, PROTESTS AND RIOTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA UNREST (2010- )"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEMONSTRATIONS, PROTESTS, AND RIOTS"}],"pub_date":"2011-04-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Anthony","lastname":"SHADID"}],"original":"By ANTHONY SHADID; Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Katherine Zoepf from New York, and employees of The New York Times from Beirut and Damascus, Syria"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b8248eb7c8105d8adfbb","word_count":929},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/14\/photos-of-the-moment-theyskens-theory\/","snippet":"Our New York Fashion Week photo diary and review of the Spring 2012 collection.","lead_paragraph":"Elle Muliarchyk's New York Fashion Week photo diary.","abstract":"Our New York Fashion Week photo diary and review of the Spring 2012 collection.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photos of the Moment | Theyskens' Theory","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-14T17:22:23Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Elle","rank":1,"lastname":"MULIARCHYK"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jane","rank":2,"lastname":"HERMAN"}],"original":"By ELLE MULIARCHYK and JANE HERMAN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a0fc8eb7c8105d8e701b","word_count":102},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/13\/photos-of-the-moment-marc-by-marc-jacobs-3\/","snippet":"A New York Fashion Week photo diary and a review of the spring 2012 collection.","lead_paragraph":"Matthew Kristall's New York Fashion Week photo diary.","abstract":"A New York Fashion Week photo diary and a review of the spring 2012 collection.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photos of the Moment | Marc by Marc Jacobs","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-13T13:48:25Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Matthew","rank":1,"lastname":"KRISTALL"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jane","rank":2,"lastname":"HERMAN"}],"original":"By MATTHEW KRISTALL and JANE HERMAN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a0fc8eb7c8105d8e7012","word_count":83},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/18\/arts\/dance\/congo-and-kabuki-and-salutes-to-mr-b.html","snippet":"A selection of dance events and performances.","lead_paragraph":"Dates are subject to change.

Guests were shown into a large room filled with fresh-cut flowers, caterers bearing trays of hors d'oeuvres and wall-to-wall chatter. The hum was baritone: men in suits outnumbered women in heels two to one. The billionaire chairman of Starbucks, Howard Schultz -- whose book, ''Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life Without Losing Its Soul,'' was the reason for the party -- stood a head taller than the crowd, watching with a smile as flush-cheeked beefy guys from his scrappy youth in Canarsie, Brooklyn, knocked back the free booze. Windows opening onto a large garden were shut to keep out the chill. Tina Brown, editor of the newly merged Newsweek and Daily Beast, was wearing a black cocktail dress and holding a wineglass filled with seltzer as she darted between CNBC's Maria Bartiromo, the former White House budget director Peter Orszag, Willie Geist of ''Morning Joe,'' the former New York City Police commissioner Bill Bratton and Oprah's best friend, Gayle King. As is not uncommon in preparation for Brown's parties, that afternoon the room's furniture was loaded into a truck, which was waiting, out of sight, for the last guests to leave before unloading its contents back into the apartment. Sir Harold Evans, Brown's 82-year-old husband, has been known to joke with friends that he'd prefer to be in the truck, where he could circle the block in the comfort of his own home.","abstract":"Peter Stevenson article profiles Tina Brown, editor of the newly merged Newsweek and Daily Beast; photos (L)","print_page":"32","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/05\/08\/magazine\/08tina1_span\/08tina1_span-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/05\/08\/magazine\/08tina1_span\/08tina1_span-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"'IT'S ROLLICKING STUFF, ISN'T IT?'"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BROWN, TINA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DAILY BEAST"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DAILY BEAST, THE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TALK MAGAZINE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"NEWSWEEK"},{"name":"organizations","value":"NEW YORKER"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"},{"name":"subject","value":"MAGAZINES"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEWS AND NEWS MEDIA"}],"pub_date":"2011-05-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine; Technology","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Peter","lastname":"STEVENSON"}],"original":"By PETER STEVENSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2ac218eb7c8105d8997ff","word_count":4860},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE0DE143FF93BA2575AC0A9679D8B63","snippet":"Dates and performers may change.
