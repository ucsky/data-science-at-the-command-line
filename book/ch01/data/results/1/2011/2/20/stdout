Within moments, industry power brokers like Linda Fargo, the sleekly imposing fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman; Simon Doonan of Barneys New York, and a visibly captivated Hamish Bowles of Vogue were rushing backstage to throw their arms around Mr. Altuzarra and to pose for the scrum of paparazzi bellowing their names. When the crowd had subsided, Mr. Altuzarra turned, without missing a beat, to a stream of reporters, spooling off his fashion influences like a schoolboy reciting his catechism. His inspirations -- a pastiche of urban signage, modern technology, tribal elements and rave culture -- were ''fractured,'' he told Amy Larocca of New York magazine. ''Fractured,'' he repeated as Tim Blanks, a critic for Style.com, thrust a microphone toward his face.","abstract":"New York Fashion Week designers like Joseph Altuzarra must dazzle the press, satisfy the retailers, answer the critics and do it all over again a few months later; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/02\/10\/fashion\/10ALTUZARRA-span\/10ALTUZARRA-span-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/02\/10\/fashion\/10ALTUZARRA-span\/10ALTUZARRA-span-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/02\/10\/fashion\/10ALTUZARRA-span\/10ALTUZARRA-span-articleLarge.jpg","height":343,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/02\/10\/fashion\/10ALTUZARRA-span\/10ALTUZARRA-span-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":343},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Another Season, Another Show","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ALTUZARRA, JOSEPH"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29e528eb7c8105d88060c","word_count":2359},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/15\/fashion\/rodarte-oscar-de-la-renta-and-narciso-rodriguez-continue-refreshing-the-dress.html","snippet":"It turns out that refreshing the dress, which is a big story in American fashion, is not as simple as it seems","lead_paragraph":"Van Gogh meets Walt Disney sounds like a dangerous liaison.
