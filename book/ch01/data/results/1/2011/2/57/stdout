After greeting the designer Tory Burch and Vogue's event director, Sylvana Soto-Ward, and hopping up and down in wobbly heels upon seeing John Galantic, the president of Chanel, Ms. Lively eventually made her way to a table. ''I was just having a conversation and I looked down and saw 'Chanel: Dinner in Honor of Blake Lively' '' she said, pointing to her menu.
