HILFIGER SHOW HITS ALL THE SEASON'S TRENDS Tommy Hilfiger's women's collection hit all of the season's big trends, before an audience that included Wyclef Jean, Rosario Dawson and fashion's latest oddball addict, Amar'e Stoudemire of the New York Knicks. The looks included sharp double-breasted gray flannel pantsuits, some shown with shearling vests, and clever takes on the navy cable-knit sweaters embroidered with beads. Printed pajamas also looked cool under a cloth coat. Ponchos and capes have been just about everywhere this season, but here there was a cool hybrid variation: wrapped around their necks, two models wore wide scarves that attached with hooks in the back, creating a quasi-poncho. One was lined with a blanket fabric.","abstract":"Roundup of excerpts from Eric Wilson's Fast Fashion posts from blog On the Runway during New York Fashion Week; photos (M)","print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"On the Runway"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"WILSON, ERIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29e548eb7c8105d880704","word_count":661},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2011\/09\/14\/fashion\/20110914OFFTHERUNWAY.html","snippet":"Scenes from New York Fashion Week on Sept. 14.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes from New York Fashion Week on Sept. 14.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Day 7: Off the Runway"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2011-09-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8d611c22dfde670c4a98","word_count":18},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2011\/09\/09\/fashion\/OFFTHERUNWAY_FW.html","snippet":"Scenes from New York Fashion Week on Sept. 9.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes from New York Fashion Week on Sept. 9.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Day 2: Off the Runway"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2011-09-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8d511c22dfde670c4a39","word_count":18},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/02\/17\/fashion\/17ROW.html","snippet":"Designers are thrilled to have CNN looking at them again.","lead_paragraph":"IT has been 10 years since CNN pulled the plug on ''Style With Elsa Klensch,'' and in that time we've gone from seeing a camera crew at Fashion Week as a novelty to seeing anyone in the audience without a camera phone as a nobody.
