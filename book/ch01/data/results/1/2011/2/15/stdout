''I did it in ignorance, the way I do everything,'' he added. ''I never really know what's going on.'' This is far from the truth, as any fashion insider could tell you. Andre Walker always seems to know what's going on and seemingly has since staging his first runway show in the Oasis, a Brooklyn club, at age 15. Mr. Walker is a kind of fashion Zelig, a man whose unofficial r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (he would never have an actual r\u00e9sum\u00e9) locates him into so many places at so many times and in the thick of so many scenes that one cannot help but be amazed when he informs you that he is just 44.","abstract":null,"print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/02\/12\/fashion\/DIARY\/DIARY-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/02\/12\/fashion\/DIARY\/DIARY-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"An Improbable Magazine From a Fashion Zelig","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK: FASHION DIARY"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Guy","lastname":"TREBAY"}],"original":"By GUY TREBAY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd289978eb7c8105d85b28e","word_count":743},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/16\/fashion\/phillip-lim-proenza-schouler-and-more-review-ny-fashion-week.html","snippet":"Notes from spring 2012 collections by Phillip Lim, Proenza Schouler, Ralph Lauren, Ralph Rucci and Reed Krakoff.","lead_paragraph":"Wednesday was a double-bonus day with outstanding shows from Ralph Rucci and Proenza Schouler. The next morning, Ralph Lauren concocted one of his romances out of straw picnic purses and robin's egg blue, ending it with a gown as triumphant as the Chrysler Building. I'm going to assume that the spelling of latex in Mr. Rucci's press notes (''laytex'') was a typo. At this point, if you know anything about him and his top-drawer preferences, you're thinking: ''What's he doing with latex? Ew.'' But Mr. Rucci was not so much daring his audience, which included Whoopi Goldberg and the chef Marcus Samuelsson, to look away as to see him in a more complete way.","abstract":null,"print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/09\/15\/fashion\/0916reviewspan\/0916reviewspan-thumbStandard-v2.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/09\/15\/fashion\/0916reviewspan\/0916reviewspan-thumbStandard-v2.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/09\/15\/fashion\/0916reviewspan\/0916reviewspan-articleLarge.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/09\/15\/fashion\/0916reviewspan\/0916reviewspan-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"For a Day, It's All Good","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK | FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LAUREN, RALPH"},{"name":"persons","value":"RUCCI, RALPH"},{"name":"organizations","value":"PROENZA SCHOULER"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd294598eb7c8105d86f000","word_count":946},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/14\/fashion\/springs-colorful-runways-review-ny-fashion-week.html","snippet":"There seems to be no escape from the orgy of prints and color consuming the runways at Donna Karan, Ohne Titel, Maria Cornejo, Tory Burch, Vera Wang and Rodarte.","lead_paragraph":"There seems to be no escape from the orgy of prints and color consuming the runways.
