This season, you can bet the 22-year-old Muse, a recent mom, will be practically ubiquitous. Four cities (New York, London, Milan and Paris) and about 100 shows per - well, you do the math. \"Fashion Week is the busiest time of each season,\" she told us as she geared up for New York. \"Whether or not I actually get any free time beforehand remains to be seen, ha!\" Right now, she fills her \"idle\" hours with running and Pilates. If she's lucky, she will be able to take a short break between cities. \"I plan to spend some time in London,\" she says. (She is from New Mexico, but her mom is English.) \"I have dear dear family and friends there.\" More than anything, she tells us that she's ready for the shows to get going. \"I like how busy it is, running around from one place to another. It's quite exhilarating,\" she says. \"I know that it will end. And when it does I think I'll go home to Santa Fe, where I grew up, and eat lots of green chili.\" Hot stuff.","abstract":"The busy model and recent mom on how she is gearing up for New York Fashion Week.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Keeping Up With Arizona Muse","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-01-24T16:42:45Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Chelsea","rank":1,"lastname":"ZALOPANY"}],"original":"By CHELSEA ZALOPANY"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39de68eb7c8105d8dfd82","word_count":210},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/08\/richard-chai-back-to-school\/","snippet":"Lincoln Center was the usual sea of black, brown and beige, apart from Dani Stahl, a Nylon editor, who wore tight bright red pants in the front row of Richard Chai's show.","lead_paragraph":"At New York Fashion Week, particularly with the September shows, there is always a slight back-to-school feeling whenever all the editors and retailers reconvene, as they did this morning in Lincoln Center, in all their latest finery.

The 24-look collection includes a black wool sateen dress accented with a Peter Pan collar, a handmade lace widow skirt and a saffron printed pantsuit based on Sizzi's sketch of a Baroque cathedral ceiling. The shoes - velvet, satin and felt wedges and heels (all vegan, to match the 33-year-old's lifestyle) in salmon, saffron and cardinal red - attest to what Sizzi learned while working as an accessories designer at Gucci, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan. Clever '60s proportions and mod collaborations with the milliner Patricia Underwood and the jeweler Thomas Bliven add a bit of nonecclesiastical zing.
