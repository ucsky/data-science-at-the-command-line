Gaining 15 pounds two years into the marital journey, however, was less than thrilling. Through a friend, I heard about Exude Fitness, a company in New York City that helps clients lose weight by jumping rope. Desperate to remove the evidence of too many overindulgent, albeit romantic meals, I scheduled a session with the company's founder, Edward Jackowski. In a few meetings he showed me how to skip rope properly and created a workout that I could do on my own. I started with a basic jump, two feet at a time, and eventually graduated to fancier moves. It turned out that a child's idea of playground fun could be an effective fitness tool for an adult: after two months of jumping several times a week, I was lighter than I had been before my wedding.","abstract":"Urban Athlete notes that jumping rope for fitness and weight loss is latest exercise trend; describes several gyms that offer classes around New York City; photo (M)","print_page":"39","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/05\/06\/arts\/06URBAN-span\/URBAN-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/05\/06\/arts\/06URBAN-span\/URBAN-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/05\/06\/arts\/06URBAN-span\/URBAN-articleLarge.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/05\/06\/arts\/06URBAN-span\/URBAN-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Hop, Skip and a Jump to Fitness","kicker":"URBAN ATHLETE"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"EXERCISE"},{"name":"subject","value":"JUMP ROPE"}],"pub_date":"2011-05-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Shivani","lastname":"VORA"}],"original":"By SHIVANI VORA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a15f8eb7c8105d885cf4","word_count":648},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/03\/13\/realestate\/13cov.html","snippet":"Buyers and sellers must choose between a large real estate agency with vast resources or a smaller firm that promises individual attention.","lead_paragraph":"THE ''A'' in A.C.
