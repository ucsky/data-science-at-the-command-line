I also love this kid Taylor Momsen very much - it's interesting to see how a teenager would apply her makeup.\" To wit, de Mey created an exaggerated version of the kind of black eye makeup he said Scott herself always wears, which included heaps of Lancome Hypnose Mascara (in black, of course) and black eye shadow layered over pencil for a gothic look. \"There's no highlight, no skin showing through,\" he said. The hairstylist Serge Normant also was inspired by the designer: \"The way L'Wren wears things, it doesn't look overly done. The girls aren't supposed to look like her, but I wanted that easiness.\" Hair was brushed into a deep side part with volume added through the crown of the head for a \"just woke up\" look, which Normant set with products from his new namesake product line. The manicurist Yuna Park filled out the look with one coat of a gold-flecked black nail polish from Lancome called Noir 29, available this fall. You know you love it.
