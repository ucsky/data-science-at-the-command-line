Is it a sound: an acoustic guitar, a pedal steel, a fiddle, a high lonesome croon? Is it regional art -- and if so, what region, exactly? (Nashville? Appalachia? Bakersfield, Calif.?) Is it a grand tradition, stretching from the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers, to Roy Acuff and Hank Williams, to Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton and George Jones, down to the present day? Is country a way of life? A worldview? The best answer might be that country is music that can't stop defining itself -- the genre that can't stop asking ''What is country music?'' The latest philosopher to tackle the problem is Brad Paisley, one of modern Nashville's biggest stars, and greatest talents. In ''This Is Country Music,'' the title track from Mr. Paisley's forthcoming ninth studio album, he offers a theory: country is what other pop music isn't. It's down-to-earth, not trendy; it prizes realism over artifice; it's steeped in traditional values -- old-time religion, the old folks at home, Old Glory. ''It ain't hip to sing about tractors, trucks, little towns, and mama\/Yeah, that might be true,'' Mr. Paisley sings.
