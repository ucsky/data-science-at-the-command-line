My answers follow. As always, you may send questions about dining out in New York restaurants to dinejournal@nytimes.com. And follow me on Twitter: @SamSifton. Q. I used to live in New York City and for that reason have been enlisted to take two elderly visitors from Wallingford, Vt., on their bucket-list tour. They wanted to go to Tavern on the Green, but it's closed. (It was always overrated anyhow.) You have recommended Per Se, but it's too expensive. We are staying on the Upper West Side for four nights. The only reservation we have made so far is Chez Napol\u00e9on, which is an old favorite.

To raise money for the restoration of Versailles, five American upstarts were invited to show their clothes alongside an equal number of what some journalists termed the ''lions'' of French fashion. The New York contenders were a decidedly motley lot: the gifted and imperious Halston; the industry stalwarts Oscar de la Renta and Bill Blass; Anne Klein, the sportswear pioneer; Stephen Burrows, a relative unknown then being touted as the future of American design. The French team, if that is the word for a collection of arch-rivals, comprised Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior (the label was designed at the time by Marc Bohan), Hubert de Givenchy, Emanuel Ungaro and Pierre Cardin.","abstract":"Luncheon at Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute honors African-American models who in 1973 were first black models to walk Paris runways; then bold move by designers helped put American fashion on the map; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/01\/13\/fashion\/13VERSAILLES-D\/13VERSAILLES-D-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/01\/13\/fashion\/13VERSAILLES-D\/13VERSAILLES-D-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/01\/13\/fashion\/13VERSAILLES-D\/13VERSAILLES-D-articleLarge.jpg","height":444,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/01\/13\/fashion\/13VERSAILLES-D\/13VERSAILLES-D-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":444},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"American Fashion's Coming-Out in Paris"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"PARIS (FRANCE)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COSTUME INSTITUTE"},{"name":"subject","value":"MODELS (PROFESSIONAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"BLACKS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-01-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Guy","lastname":"TREBAY"}],"original":"By GUY TREBAY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b81c8eb7c8105d8ada45","word_count":1480},{"web_url":"http:\/\/fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/22\/rex-vs-hue-and-other-topics\/","snippet":"Hue Jackson, who admits to being influenced by Rex Ryan, is talking a big game.","lead_paragraph":"Rex Ryan and Hue Jackson.
