Both Marc Jacobs and Ralph Rucci possess know-how, no small thing in an era of disappearing hand arts and factories. Yet Mr. Jacobs is considered cool, and Mr. Rucci is not. And by offering his shows as conceptual and social experiences, Mr. Jacobs in a way acknowledges the breakup of traditional fashion over the last 20 years. Mr. Rucci continues to make elegant clothes. Despite a burgeoning interest among young people in traditional dressmaking (the Paris-based designer Bouchra Jarrar is but one example), it's no secret that you don't need special qualifications to be a designer. What's more, consumers don't seem to care. For now, and possibly many years to come, what draws people to fashion are its celebrity and communal properties, and not how clothes are made or whether they are innovative.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn reviews New York collections by designers Marc Jacobs, Ralph Rucci, Donna Karan, Ohne Titel and Rodarte presented during New York Fashion Week.
