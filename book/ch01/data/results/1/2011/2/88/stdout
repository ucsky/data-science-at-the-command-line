He is someone with a solid base of knowledge, a light hand with details and an ego that rarely intrudes. We first met in 2008, when he took over Halston. Hardly anyone knew him; he had been Donatella Versace's assistant for many years. But Mr. Zanini brought a clean vitality to Halston, especially to the day clothes. That show remains a favorite of mine, and it was his only Halston collection because he and the owners parted ways within a few months. Then he got the gig at Rochas, and he's taken a completely different approach with the sporty French label. Mr. Zanini was in New York recently and we chatted about the business, Dior's next move - what everybody is talking about.","abstract":"I sometimes think there's a cult of Zanini - Marco Zanini, the creative director at Rochas.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Few Minutes With Marco Zanini","kicker":"On the Runway"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-04-21T16:13:39Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Cathy","rank":1,"lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39ef88eb7c8105d8e24f9","word_count":1147},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9F04E4DD123DF932A2575AC0A9679D8B63","snippet":"WHAT do a city councilman, a comedian and a catcher named Jesus have in common?
