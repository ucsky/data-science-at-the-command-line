Dior said in a statement Tuesday that it was beginning legal action to dismiss Mr. Galliano, the 50-year-old designer, whose romantic and theatrical fashion shows revitalized haute couture, following accusations of drunken anti-Semitic rants in Paris.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"International Herald Tribune","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/03\/02\/fashion\/02galliano_cnd\/02galliano_cnd-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/03\/02\/fashion\/02galliano_cnd\/02galliano_cnd-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Galliano's Departure From Dior Ends a Wild Fashion Ride","kicker":"NEWS ANALYSIS"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"CHRISTIAN DIOR SA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"LVMH MOET HENNESSY LOUIS VUITTON SA"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARIS FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-03-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Suzy","lastname":"MENKES"}],"original":"By SUZY MENKES"},"type_of_material":"An Analysis; News Analysis","_id":"4fd28a2c8eb7c8105d85c40a","word_count":741},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/08\/fashion\/fashion-week-ten-years-later-a-bond-forged-in-tragedy.html","snippet":"Ten years ago, a group of promising young designers had their careers interrupted by 9\/11.

Her first fashion show, under the tents of Bryant Park, was scheduled for 9 a.m. that day. ''It was crazy,'' she said. ''Everything was happening at once. We were using pregnant models, and instead of water, we had Krispy Kreme doughnuts and bagels backstage. There was so much coverage and excitement about the show that it really was a media circus. I had a lot of celebrities there. I remember Billy Baldwin, who was married to Chynna Phillips, who was pregnant at the time, and a lot of socialites: Marina Rust, Elizabeth Saltzman. It was the first maternity show at Fashion Week, and 'Good Morning America' and the 'Today' show were both so anxious to cover it live that they almost battled it out.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/09\/07\/fashion\/07ORAL_SPAN\/07ORAL_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/09\/07\/fashion\/07ORAL_SPAN\/07ORAL_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/09\/07\/fashion\/07ORAL_SPAN\/07ORAL_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/09\/07\/fashion\/07ORAL_SPAN\/07ORAL_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"A Bond Forged in Tragedy","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LAUREN, RALPH"},{"name":"persons","value":"DE LA RENTA, OSCAR"},{"name":"persons","value":"HERRERA, CAROLINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"SEPTEMBER 11 (2001)"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"WILSON"}],"original":"By ERIC WILSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd292628eb7c8105d86b4d3","word_count":4526},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2011\/02\/10\/t-magazine\/27tmag-profileinstyle.html","snippet":"The pint-size branding genius behind the Terminal Presents, which oversees Fashion Week\u2019s M.A.C. & Milk events hub, has fierce personal style, mixing cutting-edge designers with semi-destroyed garage-sale and flea-market finds.","lead_paragraph":"The pint-size branding genius behind the Terminal Presents, which oversees Fashion Week\u2019s M.A.C. & Milk events hub, has fierce personal style, mixing cutting-edge designers with semi-destroyed garage-sale and flea-market finds.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Jenn\u00e9 Lombardo Profile in Style"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2011-02-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a871e1c22dfde670c06f3","word_count":39},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/02\/18\/new-york-fashion-week-plenty-of-plaid\/","snippet":"This year, designers from Thakoon to Chris Benz dressed models in manly plaids.","lead_paragraph":"Men's-wear-inspired women's wear isn't anything revolutionary.

This fall plaids are designers latest nod to men's wear - and we're not talking suits. Thakoon's tribal-inspired cobalt blue and cherry red checkered 18th-century red puffer jacket would be foreign to Gaelic Scots. Similarly, Rag & Bone used a mixed color palette, but also paired neo-traditional houndstooth kilts with tough biker jackets. Some were more direct: Theyskens' Theory delivered plaids exactly how you want and expect them, a little oversized and unbuttoned, as if you threw on your boyfriend's. Conservative looks did resurface, however - patterns woven in maroon, brown and yellow made an appearance at Chris Benz as a simple long smock dress and Altuzarra-fitted trousers. Thankfully, this is one of those brilliant trends that you always have somewhere buried in your closet.
