Soon thereafter the two friends started plotting a joint venture - the first to emerge from the CFDA's incubator program. Their 10-piece offering, which made its debut at Mohapatra's spring presentation during New York Fashion Week, includes bangles with an iridescent finish that Dooley describes as \"totally trippy.\" The geode ring and pendant, which are cast in brass and then glossed in super-saturated prismatic hues, pair especially well with Mohapatra's orange harem pants; the long brushed bronze earrings look best with the designer's floor-skimming gowns. \"Those bar earrings just accentuate the collection's linear silhouettes,\" Mohapatra explains. \"They add just enough shine.\"","abstract":"CFDA Fashion Incubator designers Bibhu Mohapatra and Rachel Dooley team up to make super-saturated prismatic jewelry.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Rainbow Brights","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-11-01T17:13:24Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Sarah","rank":1,"lastname":"SCIRE"}],"original":"By SARAH SCIRE"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a1718eb7c8105d8e82cb","word_count":167},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/07\/water-works\/","snippet":"An ocean-inspired mix of jewelry, homeware and clothes, on sale for a good cause, now at Rogan's Bowery Street store.","lead_paragraph":"To kick off Fashion Week and celebrate the Quiksilver Pro New York Surf Competition, an 11-day surf extravaganza on Long Island with a $1 million prize purse, Rogan's Bowery Street store is showing a collaborative installation called Rogan vs. LOOMSTATE-SRF CTY. On display starting today: cool surf clothes and the artist Maria Moyer's exclusive \"Blue\" collection, which consists of a delightful, ocean-inspired mix of jewelry and homeware, all handcrafted and cautiously sanded to simulate the effects of spending years under the sea. Limited-edition ultramarine discs and unglazed porcelain objects evoke the work of the Austrian sculptor Carl Aubock and are gratifyingly minimal and calming. The collection is available at Rogan through late October, and 10 percent of all proceeds from the capsule will go to Waves for Water, a nonprofit that helps bring clean water to impoverished communities.","abstract":"An ocean-inspired mix of jewelry, homeware and clothes, on sale for a good cause, now at Rogan's Bowery Street store.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Water Works","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-07T16:26:00Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Lily","rank":1,"lastname":"HARRISON"}],"original":"By LILY HARRISON"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a11d8eb7c8105d8e7595","word_count":144},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/08\/19\/chic-in-review-victoria-beckhams-five-hands-of-food\/","snippet":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","lead_paragraph":"Abercrombie & FitchPays the \"Jersey Shore\" star Michael Sorrentino to stay away from its clothing brand.

The 20-piece collection, in stores Thursday, is based on a clever three-in-one concept -- that is, its component parts fit together in all manner of magical combinations. A faux fur jacket, $1,420, has detachable sleeves; a quilted leather bomber, $1,295, is lined with a shiny water-resistant nylon shell (a cool piece of outerwear on its own); a leather tote, $695, has two pockets on the outside that snap off and can be used as smaller bags; and ankle boots, $750, come with matching leather stirrups. Other pieces to mix and match include a minidress with knit sleeves, $380, and trousers with a flap front, $450.

In a new book, ''Cecil Beaton: The New York Years,'' Donald Albrecht suggests that his methods of working in a variety of media, his blurring of the lines between art and commerce, and his promotional skills made him ''remarkably prescient.'' Certainly Beaton was able to move from one medium to another: fashion photography, portraiture, illustration, costume and set design. I'm sure many designers today wish they could be liberated from their studio bunkers; the demands of work keep them pinned down like enemy fire. A few have time to express themselves in other media (and I don't mean HSN), but most have to do their dreaming with pins and fabric and mood boards. It's not so bad.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Express to the Web","kicker":"ON THE RUNWAY"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-08-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd294548eb7c8105d86ebdf","word_count":510},{"web_url":"http:\/\/bucks.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/14\/wednesday-reading-the-best-travel-web-sites\/","snippet":"A \"best of\" list for travel Web sites, poverty soars in a \"lost decade,\" Google debuts flight search and other consumer-focused news from The New York Times.","lead_paragraph":"A variety of consumer-focused articles appears daily in The New York Times and online in our blogs.
