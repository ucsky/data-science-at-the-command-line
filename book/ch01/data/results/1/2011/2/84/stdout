What links these places is not just fashion, but the design process itself and how the ideas of designers evolve over time. That evolution is one of the pleasures of Andrew Bolton's selections for the McQueen show, especially in the tailoring choices. It was inspiring to see how his cutting methods changed over his career, yet how certain assumptions remained fixed. One of the most rewarding and maddening of these assumptions is that design is a learning process. And McQueen always wanted to learn.","abstract":"In the last week I've been in the South of France for the Hy\u00e8res Fashion Festival and in San Francisco to meet students at the Academy of Art University, with a stop in New York for the opening of the Alexander McQueen exhibition.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Jury Is Still Out","kicker":"On the Runway"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-05-06T11:37:06Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Cathy","rank":1,"lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a0048eb7c8105d8e4c24","word_count":525},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/02\/15\/the-ghost-of-bill-blass\/","snippet":"her blue-tinted shades, seated at a window looking out on Lexington Avenue.

But the passing of that fabled society haunt - it shuttered a dozen years ago - has not deterred young designers from drawing on its patrician charms. In Mortimer's heyday, those charms were conferred by its patrons, and not less by their chum Bill Blass, who swathed his ladies in fox and the witty pinstripes and foulards that were the genteel uniforms of the Uptown set.","abstract":"her blue-tinted shades, seated at a window looking out on Lexington Avenue.

Most shows, she wrote on her Web site, Loop21.com, ''were about as diverse as a Tea Party rally.'' Of 144 shows last spring, she reported, 25 featured no black models at all, while others included only one or two. Just days ago, in the wake of New York Fashion Week, Ms. Goff softened her stance, having noticed an encouraging, if modest, uptick in black models on the catwalks. According to her tabulations, more than 90 percent of the 200-plus designers had at least one black model, a jump of 7 percentage points over last fall.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"An Uptick, but Enough?","kicker":"ON THE RUNWAY"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-09-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2acb78eb7c8105d899e19","word_count":500},{"web_url":"http:\/\/learning.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/03\/31\/what-memorable-poetry-have-you-ever-read-or-heard\/","snippet":"Tell us about your own experiences with poetry, positive or negative, and about any memorable poems you've encountered in your life.","lead_paragraph":"April is National Poetry Month, and to celebrate it we're asking you to write about your own experiences with verse.
