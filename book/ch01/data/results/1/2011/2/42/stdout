First embraced a couple of years ago by fashion's early adopters -- young urbanites who flaunted maxidresses and flip-flops as an airy alternative to leggings and jeans -- long skirts are now gaining traction as the most plainly discernible trend of spring.","abstract":"Long willowy flowing skirts are becoming popular for spring, but the covered-up look is often far from prim; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/04\/07\/fashion\/07SPRING-span\/Z-SPRING-P1-A-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/04\/07\/fashion\/07SPRING-span\/Z-SPRING-P1-A-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/04\/07\/fashion\/07SPRING-span\/Z-SPRING-P1-A-articleLarge.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/04\/07\/fashion\/07SPRING-span\/Z-SPRING-P1-A-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"As Days Grow Longer, So Do Hems","kicker":"Spring Fashion"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"SHOPPING AND RETAIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"DRESSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"SEASONS AND MONTHS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONSUMER BEHAVIOR"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-04-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a0128eb7c8105d883e9e","word_count":1462},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/08\/07\/fashion\/olivier-theyskens-shapes-a-new-future.html","snippet":"After several career setbacks, Olivier Theyskens has teamed up with Theory.

Visitors enter the exhibition in a space surrounded by video images from Lindbergh's recent cinematic series, \"Invasion,\" a film that depicts a crowd in slow motion moving into a cloud of smoke. Visitors to the exhibit suddenly realize they have become part of the silent choreography, as they watch their own shadows entering and exiting the images projected onto the walls.","abstract":"A look at the Peter Lindbergh and Diane Von Furstenberg exhibitions now on view in the Chinese capital.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"T in China | Art and Fashion in Beijing","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-04-21T10:30:19Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Morgan","rank":1,"lastname":"MORRIS"}],"original":"By MORGAN MORRIS"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39f0c8eb7c8105d8e2911","word_count":402},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/07\/12\/fashion\/12iht-FVERSAILLES12.html","snippet":"Modern fashion blended in well with 200-year-old garments in an exhibit to mark the closing of Paris couture.","lead_paragraph":"Modern fashion blended in well with 200-year-old garments in an exhibit to mark the closing of Paris couture.","abstract":null,"print_page":"","blog":[],"source":"International Herald Tribune","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2011\/07\/12\/fashion\/12IHTfversailles12-inline-1\/12IHTfversailles12-inline-1-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2011\/07\/12\/fashion\/12IHTfversailles12-inline-1\/12IHTfversailles12-inline-1-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2011\/07\/12\/fashion\/12IHTfversailles12-inline-1\/12IHTfversailles12-inline-1-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2011\/07\/12\/fashion\/12IHTfversailles12-inline-1\/12IHTfversailles12-inline-1-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"At Versailles, Rock \u2019n\u2019 Rococo","print_headline":"At Versailles, Rock 'N' Rococo","content_kicker":"Style"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","value":"Fashion and Apparel","name":"subject"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"France","name":"glocations"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","value":"Versailles (France)","name":"glocations"}],"pub_date":"2011-07-12T14:30:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Styles","section_name":"Fashion & Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Suzy","rank":1,"lastname":"MENKES"}],"original":"By SUZY MENKES"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52b95ad37988100ef6dd0b48","word_count":"726"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/03\/07\/kors-gets-a-place-to-hang-his-hat-in-paris\/","snippet":"The designer, who just opened his largest store in the world, celebrates with a lavish dinner for 220 guests from the fashion world and a performance by Mary J.
