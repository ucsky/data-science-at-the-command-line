Because Tommy does that healthy, American girl with bouncy hair, and I'm doing something very clean, very sharp, and very chic.\" This shift from previous seasons (it was Souleiman who was behind those healthy, bouncy heads of hair at the fall 2011 show) was implemented through flat ironing strands with the help of Wella's Shine Finish, which he called \"liquid gold,\" then tucking hair back behind the ears before pulling it into a low ponytail tied with a thin black elastic. To achieve a graphic but not hard, product-y look, Souleiman squirted a bit of Wella Professionals Stay Essential Finishing Spray on a brush blush before running it over the surface of the hair to smooth down flyaways. As it turns out, it takes almost as much work to not reinvent the wheel as it does to invent it; as he noted, \"It's so easy to do something really wacky - I could do that with my eyes shut.

She was filling in on sound byte duty for Paul Hanlon, the show's key hairstylist, who was busy presiding over the swarm of stylists - three per girl - busy scraping hair back from the face, dousing it in product (chief among them Frederic Fekkai Coiff Bouffant Lifting & Texturizing Spray Gel), clipping it into twists and coils, and setting with a blow-dryer. \"When the clips come out, they're going to start to destroy [the shapes] by pulling out pieces to make it more 3-D,\" said Outen. \"When [the models] are in the line, Paul's going to do his magic.\" In between, the makeup artist Tom Pecheux painted on a glamorous take on the '90s Kate Moss cat-eye. \"I was like, what is a young designer like? Who does he want to dress? And which kind of woman wants to wear a cool young designer? A rock chick,\" said Pecheux. His take replaced that \"rock chick\" staple, black liquid liner, with M.A.C. Rich Purple Chromagraphic Pencil on the eye's waterline and M.A.C. Keep It Cool Eye Shadow (available fall 2011), used to a soft liner effect, brushed out to the brows. \"I went for silver on the inner corner of the eye, almost like a futuristic tear.\" And the crimson lip? \"It's a huge controversy!
