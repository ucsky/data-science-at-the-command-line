Embraced in the 1940s and '50s by Jacques Fath and Christian Dior, the look, defined by a starchy little overskirt that flares from the waist, reappears every decade or so. It was picked up last season by Marc Jacobs of Louis Vuitton and Christophe Decarnin at Balmain, and revisted once more this week on the runways of Jason Wu, Vera Wang, Badgley Mischka and Rodarte, to name but a handful, lending their collections a shot of vintage Hollywood allure.","abstract":"In a season marked by all manner of flounces and frills, the peplum was a standout.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Peplum for the People","kicker":"On the Runway"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"},{"rank":"3","name":"subject","value":"New York Fashion Week"},{"rank":"2","name":"subject","value":"Fashion and Apparel"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-14T17:29:55Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Ruth","rank":1,"lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a0bd8eb7c8105d8e6646","word_count":95},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/13\/forget-your-umbrella\/","snippet":"Slicked-back hair has been all over the runways: Donna Karan, Rebecca Taylor, Derek Lam.","lead_paragraph":"Slicked-back hair has been all over the runways: Donna Karan, Rebecca Taylor, Derek Lam.

Barneys gave the party, at a former strip club near the West Side Highway, across from Alexander Wang's even bigger party at Pier 40. I got to the club right after the Joseph Altuzarra show and ran into Max Osterweis and Erin Beatty, the Suno designers. I knew Saturday would be a long day, and it was, starting at 9 a.m. with a tour of the hat exhibit that Stephen Jones has organized at the Bard Graduate Center on the Upper West Side. I saw a bunch of shows, had a good lunch with my friend Simon Ungless, dropped by to see Oscar de la Renta, who was watching the tennis match and casting models, and got locked out of the Christian Siriano show, though I managed to see the clothes backstage.
