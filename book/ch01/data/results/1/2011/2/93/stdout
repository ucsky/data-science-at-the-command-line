Insured and affluent, she could afford the best treatment -- in her case a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. But she was stunned to learn of the difficulties faced by uninsured women in the same situation, so she set out to do something about it. This documentary, directed by the newswoman Perri Peltz and released during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, chronicles Ms. Ricks's efforts to recover and her transformation from successful businesswoman to advocate for impoverished patients.
