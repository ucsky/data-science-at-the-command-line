Organized by Venus X Iceberg (nee Jazmin Venus Soto), it serves as home base to many recently emerged hybrid rave\/hip-hop genres. Soto is also producing a documentary called ''Shakedown.'' Reminiscent of the '90s cult film ''Paris Is Burning,'' it traces the intricacies of black lesbian subculture in Los Angeles. Notably, Soto keeps her love of underground and subculture balanced. As a D.J., she has gained notoriety by mixing news clips from Al Jazeera in with her beats - during a New York Fashion Week gig, she interspersed coverage from the Egyptian revolution. As she puts it, ''Even club kids should know what's going on.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.","abstract":"Venus X Iceberg (Jazmin Venus Soto) comments on her DJ gig at Manhattan club Ghe20 Goth1K during New York Fashion Week","print_page":"82","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Venus X Iceberg Rave New World","kicker":"TIMELY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SOTO, JAZMIN VENUS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GHE20 GOTH1K"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"NIGHTCLUBS AND CABARETS"}],"pub_date":"2011-04-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Women's Fashion Magazine","section_name":"Magazine; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jacob","lastname":"BROWN"}],"original":"By JACOB BROWN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd290cf8eb7c8105d8693f1","word_count":138},{"web_url":"http:\/\/video.nytimes.com\/video\/2011\/09\/13\/fashion\/100000001051180\/backstage-beauty-at-marc-by-marc-jacobs.html","snippet":"The hair and makeup at the Marc by Marc Jacobs spring 2012 show.","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Backstage Beauty at Marc by Marc Jacobs","sub":"New York Fashion Week Beauty"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-09-13T15:21:08Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Fashion & Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Video","_id":"504a76ca1c22dfde670bbee2","word_count":0},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/03\/07\/scorecard-update-john-galliano\/","snippet":"The fashion critics weigh in on Galliano's fall 2011 runway show at Paris Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"John GallianoDesigner: John GallianoDate and Location: Sunday, Mar. 6, 34 Avenue FochPhotos: slide show","abstract":"The fashion critics weigh in on Galliano's fall 2011 runway show at Paris Fashion Week.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Scorecard Update | John Galliano","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"4","name":"subject","value":"Paris Fashion Week"},{"rank":"3","name":"subject","value":"Fashion and Apparel"},{"rank":"2","name":"persons","value":"Galliano, John"},{"rank":"5","name":"subject","value":"Trade Shows and Fairs"},{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"},{"rank":"6","name":"organizations","value":"New York Times"},{"rank":"7","name":"glocations","value":"Paris (France)"}],"pub_date":"2011-03-07T10:35:54Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Alison","middlename":"S.","lastname":"COHN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By ALISON S.
