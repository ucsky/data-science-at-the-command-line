I wouldn't have picked Dior's January couture collection as a major fashion moment (John Galliano punched an out-of-date ticket for the Gibson Girl), but the scene illustrated the tension between the weird and the wonderful that exists in fashion. Dior held the show in the house, so everything was creamy with intimacy -- just what editors love as they plop down next to friends -- but it soon registered that Tavi Gevinson, the 13-year-old blogger, was in the front row. Some of the editors really hit her with looks. At the Armani show that night, the stares were openly hostile. It was obvious the older Italian ladies didn't care to see a child in their midst. And Tavi wore a big bow-shaped hat that pointedly emphasized her juvenile stature. The fact is half the people were still in the dark about what was happening. Blogs? Strange ruminations from a girl's bedroom in Chicago? They were still politely applauding satin ball gowns that Charles James would have whipped up in his sleep at the Chelsea Hotel. 2. For most of his career, Alexander McQueen was singled out as a bad-boy designer. On the runway, he certainly held nothing back. Then, on Feb. 11, he committed suicide in his London flat. There was, naturally, a tremendous outpouring of sadness and disbelief; despite a history of self-destructive behavior, he was seen as invulnerable. This was a great lie, of course. He was an isolated, unhappy man racked by bouts of paranoia. He was unable to maintain a balance, a coroner's report concluded. His death, then, made something painfully clear: he was more orphan than bad-boy genius. And that seems a good place to begin understanding his whole life.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn lists top ten important fashion moments of 2010; photos (M)","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/01\/02\/fashion\/02horyn-span\/02horyn-span-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/01\/02\/fashion\/02horyn-span\/02horyn-span-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/01\/02\/fashion\/02horyn-span\/02horyn-span-articleLarge-v2.jpg","height":369,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/01\/02\/fashion\/02horyn-span\/02horyn-span-articleLarge-v2.jpg","xlargeheight":369},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Key Fashion Moments of 2010: The passing of Alexander McQueen, and the runway return of Tom Ford."},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MCQUEEN, ALEXANDER"},{"name":"persons","value":"ROITFELD, CARINE"},{"name":"persons","value":"FORD, TOM"},{"name":"subject","value":"TWO THOUSAND TEN (YEAR)"},{"name":"subject","value":"DRESSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-01-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"List","_id":"4fd2b7968eb7c8105d8acbed","word_count":950},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE3DB1639F931A35752C0A9679D8B63","snippet":"Only YSL can make vintage as good as new.

After the success of not one but two environmentally feel-good capsule collections, New Vintage, initiated by YSL's creative director, Stefano Pilati, and Julie Gilhart, is having another go. New Vintage III's moxie is quite simple: reclaim, recycle and sustain. ''The collection is materially comprised of garments made from recycled fabric and from existing patterns instead of new ones, to start a dialogue with the market using known codes and a common language that are reassuring and familiar,'' says Pilati about the 180 pieces that will be available this week. Metallic wide leg trousers, velvet tuxedo suiting jackets and leopard-print wrap dresses with a hint of disco pay a refreshing nod to Saint Laurent's iconic 1970s designs. You'll have a second chance to finally own that missed ready-to-wear piece, and no doubt appreciate the brand's intelligent use and reuse of its existing resources. Pilati adds, ''New Vintage is meant to be part of a process, a general attempt to give a sensibility and an education to our public so that it can act consciously toward its environment.'' Today, progressive cultural shifts in consumption and sensibility seem more modern than ever.","abstract":"Yves Saint Laurent introduces new fashion line made from recycled garments; photo (S)","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Eco Echo"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"YVES SAINT LAURENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"subject","value":"RECYCLING OF WASTE MATERIALS"}],"pub_date":"2011-01-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Chelsea","lastname":"ZALOPANY"}],"original":"By CHELSEA ZALOPANY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28a2d8eb7c8105d85c576","word_count":234},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/04\/17\/fashion\/17POSSESSED.html","snippet":"Glenn O\u2019Brien developed a taste for cuff links when he shopped for jewelry from Andy Warhol.","lead_paragraph":"THE Andy Warhol monument -- an 11-foot silvery statue of the pope of pop by Rob Pruitt for the Public Art Fund, recently installed on the northwest corner of Union Square -- appears to be a success.
