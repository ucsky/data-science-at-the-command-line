Having satisfied his father's deepest aspirations for his son, Yanagawa moved on to his new passion: fashion design. With no schooling or training, he simply started making clothes, founding the brand John Lawrence Sullivan (named after the Irish boxer) and learning as he went. Seven years later, JLS is one of the more respected men's-wear companies in Japan and Yanagawa maintains a solid reputation as an excellent designer. Now, he is turning his sights on men's-wear for women.","abstract":"A professional boxer turned designer discusses his respected men's-wear line.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Lowdown | Arashi Yanagawa","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-10-07T09:00:22Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Io","middlename":"Tillett","lastname":"WRIGHT","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By IO TILLETT WRIGHT"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a1a18eb7c8105d8e87a0","word_count":364},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/07\/31\/fashion\/weddings\/jaclyn-karas-brandon-staub-weddings.html","snippet":"The bride, a publicist for a fashion line, and the bridegroom, who is to be a graduate student at Stanford, marry in Massachusetts.","lead_paragraph":"Jaclyn Brooke Karas, the daughter of Roslyn J.

''Is that really double-knit?'' one observer whispered of a black wool suit consisting of skinny flared trousers, a hip-length narrow-lapeled jacket and a long fitted vest that could serve as a minidress to nouveau Twiggys. The 24-look collection includes a black wool sateen dress accented with a Peter Pan collar, a handmade lace widow skirt and a saffron printed pantsuit based on Sizzi's sketch of a Baroque cathedral ceiling. The shoes - velvet, satin and felt wedges and heels (all vegan, to match the 33-year-old's lifestyle) in salmon, saffron and cardinal red - attest to what Sizzi learned while working as an accessories designer at Gucci, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan. Clever '60s proportions and mod collaborations with the milliner Patricia Underwood and the jeweler Thomas Bliven add a bit of nonecclesiastical zing. From $435 at Barneys New York. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Ciao, Bella","kicker":"REMIX"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-04-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Women's Fashion Magazine","section_name":"Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Chelsea","lastname":"ZALOPANY"}],"original":"By CHELSEA ZALOPANY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a0098eb7c8105d8837f3","word_count":190},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/07\/08\/chic-in-review-justin-who\/","snippet":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","lead_paragraph":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.BalenciagaNew fall 2011 ad campaign will make its debut next week on a brand-new Web site.","abstract":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chic in Review | Justin Who?","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-07-08T18:35:20Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Kathryn","rank":1,"lastname":"BRANCH"}],"original":"By KATHRYN BRANCH"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a02b8eb7c8105d8e51ac","word_count":457},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/04\/29\/chic-in-review-royal-overload\/","snippet":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","lead_paragraph":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","abstract":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chic in Review | Royal Overload","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-04-29T18:30:06Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Sarah","rank":1,"lastname":"LEON"}],"original":"By SARAH LEON"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39f2f8eb7c8105d8e2d82","word_count":417},{"web_url":"http:\/\/learning.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/16\/whats-on-your-playlist\/","snippet":"Tell us what's on your current favorite playlist.

Milan, on the other hand, has been conspicuously lacking in luxury department stores. But that all changed earlier this month, with the opening earlier of Excelsior, a multilevel shopping destination with a fashion sense that runs the gamut from Dries Van Noten to Balmain (the renowned local boutique owner Antonia Giacinti is a consultant), a trio of restaurants from the local celebrity chef Davide Oldani and departments stocked with everything from retro-fabulous meat slicers to flower arrangements by the edgy florist Numero 9. The former cinema has been reimagined by the architect Jean Nouvel as an ode to the history of film: floors are laid out as parapet balconies, and wraparound L.E.D. screens show a continuous stream of film stills. Even the sales clerks dress the part. The women who work in the cosmetics and fragrance hall on the first floor wear stripy Breton tops, cropped black trousers and ankle-strap heels and the guys who sell men's clothes on the second floor sport tartan shirts, chinos and solid ties. Despite the inauspicious location, right next to a low-end mall, and the coy facade (Nouvel hid the entrance behind a giant louvered blind, and there are no window displays), we foresee a flurry of fashion-week pilgrimages.","abstract":"Milan has been conspicuously lacking in luxury department stores, but that all changed earlier this month, with the opening earlier of Excelsior, a multilevel shopping destination.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"One-Stop Shopping in Milan","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-22T10:00:38Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Nancy","rank":1,"lastname":"MACDONELL"}],"original":"By NANCY MACDONELL"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a0fc8eb7c8105d8e7020","word_count":238},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/02\/21\/scorecard-mulberry-wins\/","snippet":"Another day of runway looks, another Scorecard at your service.","lead_paragraph":"Scorecard, here, checking in with your weekend recap of all that's new in London fashion.
