And unlike the disastrous end to its first go-round decades ago, the carmaker has already managed to create a buzz. Fiat owns Chrysler, which it bought as part of Chrysler's government-sponsored bankruptcy two years ago. Now Fiat is using its Chrysler foothold in this country to sell one of its own cars -- the Fiat 500 -- for the first time since 1983, when it officially left the market.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/09\/03\/business\/FIAT1\/FIAT1-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/09\/03\/business\/FIAT1\/FIAT1-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Fiat's Retro Return"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"CHRYSLER LLC"},{"name":"organizations","value":"FIAT SPA"},{"name":"subject","value":"AUTOMOBILES"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Nick","lastname":"BUNKLEY"}],"original":"By NICK BUNKLEY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd294558eb7c8105d86ecf2","word_count":1182},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/03\/06\/arts\/dance\/06keigwin.html","snippet":"The busy choreographer Larry Keigwin has a one-week engagement at the Joyce, where his full-evening work \u201cExit\u201d will have its premiere.","lead_paragraph":"IS there any kind of stage or dance work that Larry Keigwin hasn't yet turned his hand to?

She assumed it was as bland as everyone said, and when she packed her bags and moved there soon after, she found plenty of Europeans who agreed. ''The people I was hanging out with at the time referred to it as the Mexico of Europe,'' she says. ''Everyone wanted to go to Paris or London or Amsterdam, and Brussels was just this weird place in the middle.'' At first, Vantzou stayed mostly for her relationship and for the hefty artist's stipend she received from the Belgian government, having secured E.U. citizenship by way of her Greek father. But then a funny thing happened. Not only was she discovering that there was more to the cultural scene than she'd imagined, she was also watching as other artists - Parisians, even - began settling in the city. Long ignored or even mocked by its neighbors, Brussels seemed to be entering a kind of creative renaissance. ''Where it used to be like 'Brussels? Why the heck would you move there?' these days it's like, 'Oh, yeah, I've been hearing about all the stuff happening there,' '' Vantzou says. ''Brussels used to be this forgotten place, and suddenly people are talking about it like they were talking about Berlin 10 years ago.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"62","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Belge Epoque","kicker":"TALK"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-09-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Travel Magazine","section_name":"Travel; Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Monica","lastname":"KHEMSUROV"}],"original":"By MONICA KHEMSUROV"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a2888eb7c8105d887ba0","word_count":1611},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9901E0DA123FF935A35750C0A9679D8B63","snippet":"International     EGYPTIAN WOMEN SEEK   ","lead_paragraph":"International EGYPTIAN WOMEN SEEK","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Inside The Times"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-03-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Summary","_id":"4fd2a0058eb7c8105d883561","word_count":1634},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=980DE7DD1438F931A35752C0A9679D8B63","snippet":"International     TOP TEHRAN PROSECUTOR VOWS   ","lead_paragraph":"International TOP TEHRAN PROSECUTOR VOWS","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Inside the Times"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-01-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Summary","_id":"4fd28a278eb7c8105d85c054","word_count":1463}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
