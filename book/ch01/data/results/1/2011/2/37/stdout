The British graffiti artist and prankster's inversion of the weary Warhol dictum about fame comes as a tonic in an age of self-promotion and so-called social media.

My take on the London show was that while it was not as loaded with personality and ageless styles as his first Tom Ford women's line a year ago, the show suggested that he might have felt the need to beef up the day clothes and evening separates. Some of those styles might need a better reinterpretation, looking ahead, but why completely reinvent the Ford look?","abstract":"Tom Ford left such an indelible mark at Gucci that when he showed fringed leather skirts and sexy peasant tops in London this week, a few guests were surprised, and naturally thought of his Gucci years.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Gucci's New Deco: Hard Going","kicker":"On the Runway"},"keywords":[{"rank":"4","name":"persons","value":"Giannini, Frida"},{"rank":"3","name":"persons","value":"Ford, Tom"},{"rank":"2","name":"persons","value":"Ferretti, Alberta"},{"rank":"5","name":"subject","value":"Fashion and Apparel"},{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"},{"rank":"6","name":"organizations","value":"Gucci"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-21T14:05:57Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Cathy","rank":1,"lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a1548eb7c8105d8e7d3b","word_count":344},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/05\/24\/fashion\/24iht-fmango24.html","snippet":"Mango\u2019s fashion show atop the Centre Pompidou in Paris was a reflection of the company\u2019s global ambition.","lead_paragraph":"PARIS -- The Spanish clothing chain Mango made a bold move into the international fashion arena last week when it staged its first fashion show outside its home country.

High atop the Centre Pompidou in central Paris, 400 guests were presented with a deftly executed show in which models took to a mirrored runway in fashionable basics with a slightly '70s vibe.
