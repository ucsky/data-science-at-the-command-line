First on a list that T: The New York Times Style Magazine will continue rolling out next week is ASOS. It is a British-based e-tailer that stocks a range of labels -- from heritage (Filson) to high-end (Prada) to Scandinavian (Henrik Vibskov) -- under one URL. The site's extensive mix of prices and styles caters to the male buyer who appreciates one-stop shopping. And streamlining the process even more is ASOS's affordable namesake line, which offers slim, tailored classics (like these houndstooth trousers, $72) trendier pieces (knit jacket, $198, and Fair Isle hoodie, $87), and more.
