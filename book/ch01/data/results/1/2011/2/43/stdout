It is as if the cast of ''Mad Men,'' the cult television series based on a New York advertising office in the 1960s, had migrated to the men's shows and been re-branded for the 21st century. The focus in the Paris menswear week has been the suit. Smart dressing included the graceful glamour of a fur collar or a single white lapel at Dries Van Noten's standout show, while Yohji Yamamoto put his hefty tweed suits on men of all shapes and sizes. Cardigans, as tailored as cloth, illustrated Junya Watanabe's walk in the park. And the Viktor & Rolf duo saw matching pieces as both jackets and trousers and cotton shirts with underpants. Perhaps the biggest shock was at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons on Friday, where the tail coat, a frequent menswear symbol, was worn with flowery decadence over patterned pants or long skirts, by tousle-haired young men who looked as if they had come straight out of an opium den.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"International Herald Tribune","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2010\/06\/14\/fashion\/suzy-menkes-75\/suzy-menkes-75-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2010\/06\/14\/fashion\/suzy-menkes-75\/suzy-menkes-75-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/01\/21\/style\/global\/rmad\/rmad-articleLarge.jpg","height":360,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/01\/21\/style\/global\/rmad\/rmad-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":360},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Mad Men!

He's someone with a solid base of knowledge, a light hand with details and an ego that rarely intrudes. We met in 2008, when he took over Halston. Hardly anyone knew him; he had been Donatella Versace's assistant for many years. But Mr. Zanini brought a clean vitality to Halston, especially to the day clothes. That show remains a favorite of mine -- and it was his only Halston collection, because within a few months he and the owners parted ways. Then he got the gig at Rochas, and he's taken a completely different approach with the sporty French label. Mr. Zanini was in New York recently and we chatted about the business, Dior's next move -- what everybody is talking about. Q.

Conditioned as I am to peering under the surfaces of things and sussing out the dark truth, how am I to parse the enigma of transparency - the lack of discernible neuroses, the absence of characterological curveballs - that is Tory Burch? Despite her many roles as a ragingly successful business entrepreneur, divorced mother of three sons and devoted stepmother to three daughters, crack skier and tennis ace, adored friend, philanthropist, consummate hostess and general woman about town, she is disconcertingly all of a piece. There is - but how can this be? Can Dostoyevsky be all wrong? - no lurking secret self, no rattling skeletons. What you see, as God knows how many people have told me about her, ranging from her own mother to the society maven Billy Norwich, is what you get. And what you get, as far as I can tell, having spent some time with her and having talked to numerous people about her, is someone annoyingly close to perfect. Someone it would be nice to dislike, if she were only dislikable. Someone it's impossible not to envy, if only because her life seems sun drenched from the get-go, with a childhood that sounds near magical, spent climbing trees and romping with her brothers and the German shepherds her parents bred on a 35-acre gentleman's farm in Valley Forge, Pa., replete with tennis court and swimming pool. But here I am sitting with her at lunch in early October at one of her favorite haunts - Kelly and Ping on Greene Street in SoHo - and what I can't help noticing immediately is that she really listens, not like a person pretending to be interested until she gets the chance to talk but like someone who's actually intrigued by what you have to say. Right now, for instance, we are discussing the ordeal of clinical depression - one of my favorite subjects. My sense is that bleakness is not a component of Burch's inner landscape (indeed, her sister-in-law Patty Isen tells me that she's ''not that kind of person''), but all the same she seems compassionate, tells me about a dear friend of hers who suffers from the disease. For a moment or two I forget that I am here to interview her, rather than vice versa.","abstract":"Profile of fashion designer Tory Burch, who is known for her warm personality and work ethic, as well as the classic simplicity of her clothing line.
