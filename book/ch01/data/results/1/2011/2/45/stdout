The Argument: Consumerism has long been considered a cornerstone of democracy and a civic obligation in American society. Ms. Pham examines why the fashion industry, in particular, became the emblem of freedom and economic revitalization following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ''Freedom to shop is one of the fundamental liberties terrorists want to deprive us of,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declared in October 2001 at the start of Fashion Week in New York. Ms. Pham, an assistant professor of art history and Asian-American studies at Cornell University, argues that the ability to express oneself through dress could be starkly represented as a symbol of democracy in comparison with the burqa, which was denounced as an example of Taliban repression and invoked when government officials listed the humanitarian justifications for the war in Afghanistan. Ms. Pham complains that this assumption about the burqa, however, ignores the desires of Muslim women who may choose to be covered and discounts the hostility that the Muslim veil has sometimes incited in Western societies.","abstract":"Minh-Ha T Pham article in Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, argues that the fashion industry became an emblem of freedom and economic revitalization after the 9\/11 attacks; photo (M)","print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Fashion: Consumerism Post-9\/11","kicker":"ARTS BEAT"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"PHAM, MINH-HA T"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"subject","value":"SEPTEMBER 11 (2001)"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESEARCH"}],"pub_date":"2011-07-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Patricia","lastname":"COHEN"}],"original":"By PATRICIA COHEN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2925c8eb7c8105d86af22","word_count":477},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/03\/16\/now-watching-bill-cunningham-new-york\/","snippet":"An exclusive clip from the documentary \"Bill Cunningham New York,\" which begins a two-week run today at Film Forum.","lead_paragraph":"Here's an exclusive clip from \"Bill Cunningham New York,\" which begins a two-week run today at Film Forum.
