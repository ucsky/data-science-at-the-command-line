Tory Burch's presentation on Sunday -- not a show per se but a continuous loop of models -- drew top retailers but also a throng of enthusiastic young people, many of whom look at the clothes through their cameras or cellphones with a concentration seldom warranted by '70s-style sportswear with an English twist. What mattered, clearly, was their presence and enthusiasm, their acknowledgment of Ms. Burch as a fashion star, and that this feeling will be refracted through their images and by what they may say on blogs. You can easily imagine the audience (and the even larger one outside the tents at Lincoln Center) being the same one that loves ''Glee.''","abstract":"Cathy Horyn reviews New York collections presented during Fashion Week by designers Carolina Herrera, Derek Lam, Diane Von Furstenberg, The Row and Tory Burch; photos (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/02\/14\/fashion\/14_fashion_review\/14_fashion_review-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/02\/14\/fashion\/14_fashion_review\/14_fashion_review-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/02\/14\/fashion\/14_fashion_review\/14_fashion_review-articleLarge.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/02\/14\/fashion\/14_fashion_review\/14_fashion_review-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"More Than Meets the iPhone Lens","kicker":"FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VON FURSTENBERG, DIANE"},{"name":"persons","value":"OLSEN, MARY-KATE"},{"name":"persons","value":"HERRERA, CAROLINA"},{"name":"persons","value":"PANICHGUL, THAKOON"},{"name":"persons","value":"LAM, DEREK"},{"name":"persons","value":"OLSEN, ASHLEY"},{"name":"persons","value":"BURCH, TORY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ROW, THE"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd289a18eb7c8105d85ba2b","word_count":915},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9402E7DB153DF93BA3575AC0A9679D8B63","snippet":"FASHION WEEK is more than willowy models traipsing runways in a seizure-inducing flurry of flashbulbs.

It is for this reason that the crowd at the Ace Hotel often looks as if it is part of a viral marketing campaign for L. L. Bean, and why you can buy Alden boots and Barbour jackets at your local J. Crew. It is also why young men's designers today seem to be getting lost in the past: they have no real heritage of their own.","abstract":"Eric Wilson Fashion Review on men's Fashion Week collections from N Hoolywood, Duckie Brown, Robert Geller, Billy Reid and Band of Outsiders; photos (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/02\/14\/fashion\/MENS-1\/MENS-1-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/02\/14\/fashion\/MENS-1\/MENS-1-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Heritage Shouldn't Reek of Mothballs","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK: FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REID, BILLY"},{"name":"persons","value":"GELLER, ROBERT"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DUCKIE BROWN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BROWN, DUCKIE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BAND OF OUTSIDERS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"RAG & BONE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"N HOOLYWOOD"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEN AND BOYS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"WILSON"}],"original":"By ERIC WILSON"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd28a318eb7c8105d85c829","word_count":612},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2011\/09\/12\/fashion\/20110912SCENE4.html","snippet":"Scenes from Sunday: Wren screening and Timo Weiland after party","lead_paragraph":"Scenes from Sunday: Wren screening and Timo Weiland after party","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Fashion Week Parties, Night 4"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARTIES (SOCIAL)"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2011-09-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8d611c22dfde670c4b0b","word_count":20},{"web_url":"http:\/\/video.nytimes.com\/video\/2011\/09\/08\/t-magazine\/100000001041220\/new-york-fashion-week--tom-bull.html","snippet":"The Moment follows Tom Bull on a casting call for Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"New York Fashion Week | Tom Bull","sub":"A model on Fashion Week casting"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-09-08T13:45:47Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Video","_id":"504a76dc1c22dfde670bbf23","word_count":0},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/08\/fashion\/critics-notebook-the-endless-runway-new-york-fashion-week.html","snippet":"The must-see collections in Paris, Milan and New York this fall.","lead_paragraph":"THIS summer, one of the hottest attractions in Paris was the Madame Gr\u00e8s exhibition at the Mus\u00e9e Bourdelle. Gr\u00e8s was an inscrutable genie of haute couture whose weird demise in 1993 (her only child kept the news of her death secret for more than a year) capped one of the strangest, most productive lives in fashion. I know of several American designers who went out of their way to catch the show before it closed in late July. Gr\u00e8s was obsessed with craft, but in contrast to the methods of designers of the last 15 years, she did not create gimmick-ridden clothes. For all the fabric that went into her pleated dresses, there was a sublime economy to the form, a point reinforced by the bare-bones style of the exhibition. The curator, Olivier Saillard, the director of the Mus\u00e9e Galliera, said the cost was about 10,000 euros, or less than $15,000. That's a pittance. He could have found big-name sponsors, but he didn't want them. Corporate money has stultified fashion, pushing extravagance and disregarding ethics.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/09\/08\/fashion\/08JPNOTEBOOK3\/08JPNOTEBOOK3-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/09\/08\/fashion\/08JPNOTEBOOK3\/08JPNOTEBOOK3-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"The Endless Runway","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK | CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a37d8eb7c8105d8890a7","word_count":1084},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/12\/fashion\/mens-wear-review-ny-fashion-week.html","snippet":"The takeaway from collections by N.

Hoolywood collection. And yet, Mr. Obana's show, in a pitch-black theater at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center on Friday night, was utterly engrossing. Though he is coming at the notion of American sportswear from the viewpoint of an outsider, Mr. Obana, a Tokyo vintage dealer who started his intentionally misspelled label a decade ago, only recently showing it in New York, has mastered the details so well that you can hardly distinguish his clothes from those he mines. Then you sense that something is a little too perfect.","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/09\/12\/fashion\/12reviewspan\/12reviewspan-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/09\/12\/fashion\/12reviewspan\/12reviewspan-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"You Look Familiar Somehow","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK | FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MEN AND BOYS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"WILSON"}],"original":"By ERIC WILSON"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd2a2858eb7c8105d887951","word_count":522},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/08\/fashion\/kate-middletons-style-felt-on-the-runways-new-york-fashion-week.html","snippet":"Designers look to the styles worn by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.","lead_paragraph":"AS he lounged near a pool in Southampton, N.Y., last month, Wes Gordon had an epiphany. A group of young women gathered nearby were poring over an issue of People, its pages teeming with images of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Sheathed in trim-fitting dresses, her slender arms covered almost to the wrist, the duchess impressed them as a model of regal aplomb. They could not seem to get enough of her, Mr. Gordon recalled. Not her slim dresses, nor her pumps, her J Brand jeans or see-through hose. But mostly they chattered about her sleeves.
