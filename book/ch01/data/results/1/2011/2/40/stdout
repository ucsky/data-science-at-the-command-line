What links these places is not just fashion, but the design process itself and how the ideas of designers evolve over time. That evolution is one of the pleasures of Andrew Bolton's selections for the McQueen show, especially in the tailoring choices. It was inspiring to see how his cutting methods changed over his career, yet how certain assumptions remained fixed. One of the most rewarding and maddening of these assumptions is that design is a learning process. And Mr. McQueen always wanted to learn.","abstract":"Design schools are releasing 2011 graduates into the wild of the fashion industry, bringing some new looks to the Hyeres Fashion Festival in the South of France. photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Jury Is Still Out","kicker":"ON THE RUNWAY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"HYERES ISLANDS (FRANCE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-05-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2ac228eb7c8105d899878","word_count":522},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/12\/14\/for-fashion-start-ups-a-bridge-to-investors\/","snippet":"In a setting reminiscent of a speed-dating bar scene, more than 20 fledgling fashion companies pitched their talent, their drive and their ideas to an audience of potential investors at the Fashion Institute of Technology last week.","lead_paragraph":"IN a setting reminiscent of a speed-dating bar scene, but with no promise of even a first date, much less a long-term relationship, more than 20 fledgling fashion companies pitched their talent, their drive and their ideas to an audience of potential investors at the Fashion Institute of Technology last week.","abstract":"In a setting reminiscent of a speed-dating bar scene, more than 20 fledgling fashion companies pitched their talent, their drive and their ideas to an audience of potential investors at the Fashion Institute of Technology last week.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"For Fashion Start-Ups, a Bridge to Investors","kicker":"On the Runway"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-12-14T17:06:03Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Simone","middlename":"S.","lastname":"OLIVER","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By SIMONE S.
