''I like to concentrate on the cuteness of what I'm eating,'' Ms. Zeva said. She had switched from coconut and almond veganice cream to a skirt steak. In a black minidress, black stockings, a sheer black and navy metallic robe and a floppy black hat, with dozens of long silver and gold chains slung from her neck, she looked like a brunette Stevie Nicks in miniature.","abstract":"Profile of Bebe Zeva, 18-year-old Internet fashion celebrity who is subject of Tao Lin and Megan Boyle's documentary of same name; photos (M)","print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/07\/07\/fashion\/Z-UP-CLOSE-1\/Z-UP-CLOSE-1-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/07\/07\/fashion\/Z-UP-CLOSE-1\/Z-UP-CLOSE-1-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Becoming One Of the 'Relevant'","kicker":"UP CLOSE"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"BEBE ZEVA (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"BOYLE, MEGAN"},{"name":"persons","value":"ZEVA, BEBE"},{"name":"persons","value":"LIN, TAO"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARTIES (SOCIAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"BLOGS AND BLOGGING (INTERNET)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"}],"pub_date":"2011-07-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Movies; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Christian","lastname":"LORENTZEN"}],"original":"By CHRISTIAN LORENTZEN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a0ae8eb7c8105d8847dd","word_count":1288},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/04\/24\/fashion\/24knockoff.html","snippet":"The royal wedding dress will inspire replicas or adaptations at every level of the marketplace, within weeks or even days of its debut.","lead_paragraph":"WHEN Kate Middleton strides down the aisle at Westminster Abbey on Friday, millions of Americans watching at home will be transfixed by her gown.

Gardeners wait for the first hard frost, the one that blackens the basil and pulps the tomatoes still on the vine. For some, it's the smell of wood smoke or the sight of leaves flaming out one tree species at a time. In New York City, there are different measures. Fall begins when street fashion slips into thermal chaos -- down jackets, shawls, bermudas and flip-flops all on the same block. Fall begins, as it did this week, when the residual heat in the subway station feels strangely welcome. The approach to autumn has been murkier than usual this year -- a long, damp slog toward October, days of rain all across the Northeast. We can hope, after the first hard frost, for a week or so of Indian summer. But there is really no proper name for the slice of the season we've had so far. This fall has been made of moments from late May, a few gray days from early June, some Sundays that April discarded, and a week or so that seems to have been orphaned entirely, with no month to call home.","abstract":"Editorial notes that the approach of autumn has been murkier than usual this year in New York, and yearns for a sustained and recognizable fall season rather than a prognostication of winter or a postponement of summer","print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What Kind of Fall Am I?","kicker":"EDITORIAL"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"WEATHER"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SEASONS AND MONTHS"}],"pub_date":"2011-10-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd2a3808eb7c8105d88935c","word_count":288},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/05\/26\/fashion\/the-buzz.html","snippet":"A preview of the must-attend parties, talked-about openings and fashionable nightspots for the week ahead.","lead_paragraph":"A PREVIEW of the must-attend parties, talked-about openings and fashionable nightspots for the week ahead.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE BUZZ"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARTIES (SOCIAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"NIGHTCLUBS AND CABARETS"}],"pub_date":"2011-05-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Denny","lastname":"LEE"}],"original":"By DENNY LEE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd290c58eb7c8105d868c52","word_count":436},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/02\/16\/photos-of-the-moment-halston\/","snippet":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Samantha Casolari.","lead_paragraph":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Samantha Casolari.","abstract":"Scenes from the New York Fashion Week photo diary of Samantha Casolari.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photos of the Moment | Halston","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-16T11:30:51Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Samantha","rank":1,"lastname":"CASOLARI"}],"original":"By SAMANTHA CASOLARI"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39ec38eb7c8105d8e1c7d","word_count":28},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE0D9143EF937A25757C0A9679D8B63","snippet":"ALBANY - Gov.
