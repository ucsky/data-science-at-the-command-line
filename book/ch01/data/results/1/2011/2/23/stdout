First, there was all the weirdness of her predecessor's departure. Was Carine Roitfeld, who held the post for 10 years, fired or did she resign, as Cond\u00e9 Nast maintained? Second, the swift promotion of Ms. Alt from the No. 2 position of fashion director suggested that her bosses weren't looking for much change. As she herself said, ''They know my work by heart, and probably they felt like it was safe for them.'' Vogue editors do not come along every day, except in China and India, where Western fashion magazines are new. Anna Wintour (American Vogue) and Franca Sozzani (Italian Vogue) have each held their jobs for 22 years; Alexandra Shulman, the chief of British Vogue, a little less. If anything, the cult of the editor has exploded in the last decade, with books, documentaries and fan sites like I Want to be a Roitfeld, which is dedicated not just to Ms. Roitfeld but also to offspring.
