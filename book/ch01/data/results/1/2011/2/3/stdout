a fruity yet rich Bordeaux. The color has been brightened and lightened, making it appear more like a Beaujolais nouveau rather than a deeper Pauillac, with bursts of fuchsia in the mix to provide balance. Although it appeared on upper-length leather gloves and platforms on heels, designers sought to liven up their looks with a new color. Olivier Theyskens's second collection for Theory took a traditional approach with his wine-colored chunky knits, while Marc Jacobs played with the shade in all textures and lengths ranging from a pailette knee-length skirt to a pleated maxi version. The newcomer Prabal Gurung showed all varietals in a color-saturated fur coat over a sheer black dress, but no one did it like Posh, who provided standouts in the form of loose dresses in cashmeres and double-faced wools.
