Surprisingly, it wasn't the '60s that inspired the up-do that Pita referred to as \"Kim Novak-y,\" rather Von Furstenberg's starting point for the collection: \"New Beginnings.\" For makeup, this meant James Kaliardos used M.A.C. products for a face inspired by the land where it all began: Africa. The idea was to highlight the planes and tones of the face using an earthy (literally) palette of eight Cr\u00e8me Color Base shades, including Ochre, Pale Peach and Dark Brown. The inner and outer corner of the eye was highlighted with a khaki variation, while the middle of the lid was done in white or yellow. There was no lip, just as nails were kept clean, coated with only Sally Hansen's Hard as Nails.
