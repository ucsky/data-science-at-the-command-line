It's not just that they're the bandleaders and the composers; they're also the content providers, the song finders, the place setters. They're the ones with the strongest chordal instruments, the most powerful harmony machines; they bring in the most outside materials and translate them into the language of their time and place. This is the tradition of Jelly Roll Morton, Duke Ellington, John Lewis, Keith Jarrett, Herbie Hancock and more recently of Jason Moran and Robert Glasper and Vijay Iyer.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/10\/07\/arts\/07PIANISTS1_SPAN\/07PIANISTS1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/10\/07\/arts\/07PIANISTS1_SPAN\/07PIANISTS1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/10\/07\/arts\/07PIANISTS1_SPAN\/07PIANISTS1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","height":360,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/10\/07\/arts\/07PIANISTS1_SPAN\/07PIANISTS1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":360},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"New Pilots at the Keyboard","kicker":"CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"DAVIS, KRIS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MANHATTAN SCHOOL OF MUSIC"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CARNEGIE HALL"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"JAZZ"}],"pub_date":"2011-10-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ben","lastname":"RATLIFF"}],"original":"By BEN RATLIFF"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2926b8eb7c8105d86b850","word_count":2404},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/12\/arts\/design\/postmodern-but-not-especially-proud-of-it.html","snippet":"The Victoria & Albert Museum had difficulty persuading designers to accept being included in its new retrospective: \"Postmodernism: Style and Subversion 1970-1990.\"","lead_paragraph":"LONDON -- If I had to choose one event that summed up the influence of postmodernism on design, it would be the debut of the Memphis design group at a party in Milan on Sept. 18, 1981. There are lots of reasons for picking it -- not all of them good. Memphis's kitsch, colorful furniture was a populist representation of the postmodernist theories that had dominated avant-garde discourse in architecture and design for over a decade. Its success at interpreting those ideas so appealingly encouraged others to try too. Nothing wrong with that, except that the results were often risible. Ever squirted lemon juice in an eye when using one of Philippe Starck's squid-shaped lemon squeezers?
