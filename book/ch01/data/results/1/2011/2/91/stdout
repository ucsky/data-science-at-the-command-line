But as hotels scramble to distinguish themselves, many are rethinking their shops, upgrading and expanding merchandise and fashioning shops as destinations for both guests and local residents, much as they did with restaurants a decade ago. More Barneys than Walgreens, shops at many upscale hotels in the United States and abroad are increasingly flaunting the trappings of high-style boutiques. In addition to toothpaste and floss, the shops now stock items found in voguish gift shops, fashion emporiums and even art galleries. They also stock goods specially made for the hotel that go beyond bathrobes and sheets.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Hospitality Boutiques"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"BUSINESS TRAVEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOTELS AND MOTELS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2011-08-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Terry","lastname":"TRUCCO"}],"original":"By TERRY TRUCCO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2925e8eb7c8105d86b13f","word_count":1018},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9401EEDF153CF936A2575AC0A9679D8B63","snippet":"AT Lincoln Center last Friday morning, at the somewhat challenging hour of 9:30, the fashion and reality-TV worlds converged into one during the taping of the finale of this season's edition of ''Project Runway.''

The packed house lacked the usual star wattage of New York Fashion Week (the celebrity contingent included Jennifer Love Hewitt, Andie MacDowell, Thomas Jane, the guest judge L'Wren Scott and two of the ''Mob Wives''), but the crowd seemed content to be in the presence of the real stars of the event: the judges. Before the show, more than a few fans crowded around the seats where Michael Kors, Heidi Klum and Nina Garcia would soon sit and pass judgment, some taking iPhone photos of the empty seats with the judges' names listed on placards.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"'Project Runway' Makes It Real","kicker":"ON THE RUNWAY"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-09-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Stuart","lastname":"EMMRICH"}],"original":"By STUART EMMRICH"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd292638eb7c8105d86b5a1","word_count":732},{"web_url":"http:\/\/wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/06\/24\/gnarly\/","snippet":"I did it!

In it we will be putting helpful tips for (wait for it) solving. Our own Martin Herbach was kind enough to research and write up a new page about how to enter multiple letters for rebus entries, and there is an interesting article from puzzlemaster Will Shortz. Stay tuned for more additions, and if there is anything else you would like to see there, please contact me at deb.amlen@nytimes.com.","abstract":"I did it! I did a Saturday puzzle all by myself!
