The British-born designer, 73, has created typefaces for newspapers (including The New York Times), phone books and computer companies; he designed the fonts Verdana and Georgia that Microsoft added to Windows in 1996 and later distributed freely. Ubiquity has its rewards. Thursday, the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum will announce that it is honoring Mr. Carter with the 2011 National Design Award for lifetime achievement. The accolade follows on the heels of a MacArthur Foundation fellowship.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Honoring a Designer Who Gave Computers Their Fonts","kicker":"CURRENTS | AWARDS"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-05-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"House & Home\/Style Desk","section_name":"Home and Garden; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Julie","lastname":"LASKY"}],"original":"By JULIE LASKY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2ab0a8eb7c8105d897555","word_count":465},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/08\/07\/books\/review\/inside-the-list.html","snippet":"In her latest best seller, \u201cOf Thee I Zing,\u201d the conservative pundit Laura Ingraham takes aim at the nation\u2019s \u201clactating daddies,\u201d FarmVille gamers and \u201ccreative\u201d baby names.","lead_paragraph":"NAMING NAMES: The cover of Laura Ingraham's latest best seller, ''Of Thee I Zing: America's Cultural Decline From Muffin Tops to Body Shots,'' shows the conservative firebrand dressed up like George Washington crossing the Delaware. Inside, however, she comes on more like Andy Rooney shouting at the nation's ''lactating daddies,'' FarmVille gamers and Ugg-booted children to get off her lawn. Ingraham is also plenty exercised about ''creative'' names, especially when bestowed on celebrity children, like Bronx (Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz), Apple (Gwyneth Paltrow), Blanket (Michael Jackson), Jermajesty (Jermaine Jackson), and Pilot Inspektor (Jason Lee). ''Children should not be named after a piece of furniture, a planet, a fruit or an herb,'' Ingraham, who wrote the book with Raymond Arroyo, declares. ''Today's little ones are saddled with some of the most ridiculous names ever -- it's as if the parents are trying to force the kids to hate them early.'' (Apparently the problem stretches beyond obviously weird monikers: Ingraham cites a 2009 study in Social Science Quarterly suggesting that a child's name can predispose him to a life of crime, with the most ''dangerous'' names being Alec, Ernest, Garland, Ivan, Kareem, Luke, Malcolm, Preston, Tyrell and Walter.) On the positive side, Ingraham does come out strongly against the noxious high-end cupcake craze, and throws in a section on bad pickup lines that suggests that things inside the Beltway are even worse than you think. Gentlemen, if you want to pick up a leggy blond pundit, do not say, as one guy did to Ingraham, ''I may not be the best-looking guy in here, but I'm the only one talking to you.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/08\/07\/books\/review\/07insidelist\/07insidelist-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/08\/07\/books\/review\/07insidelist\/07insidelist-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Inside the List","kicker":"TBR"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}],"pub_date":"2011-08-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jennifer","lastname":"SCHUESSLER"}],"original":"By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2ac1b8eb7c8105d8992c0","word_count":587},{"web_url":"http:\/\/thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/02\/highway-bill-could-face-congressional-gridlock\/","snippet":"Just over a month after a Congressional stalemate held up financing for the Federal Aviation Administration, a similar fate may loom for a major highways bill.","lead_paragraph":"Here we go again?","abstract":"Just over a month after a Congressional stalemate held up financing for the Federal Aviation Administration, a similar fate may loom for a major highways bill.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Highway Bill Could Face Congressional Gridlock","kicker":"The Caucus"},"keywords":[{"rank":"4","name":"subject","value":"Infrastructure (Public Works)"},{"rank":"3","name":"persons","value":"Johnson, Tim"},{"rank":"2","name":"persons","value":"Boxer, Barbara"},{"rank":"5","name":"subject","value":"United States Politics and Government"},{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"},{"rank":"6","name":"organizations","value":"House of Representatives"},{"rank":"7","name":"organizations","value":"Senate"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-02T01:07:58Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Sarah","middlename":"Maslin","lastname":"NIR","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By SARAH MASLIN NIR"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a11c8eb7c8105d8e74cd","word_count":575},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DA1E3CF931A35755C0A9679D8B63","snippet":"LAST year, as a junior at the Latin School in Chicago, Colby Jordan wore a black silk gown designed by John Galliano with matching Dior heels to prom.

Still, there's a spirit of enterprise in the capital, which was the top destination in the New York Times Travel section's ''The 41 Places to Go in 2011'' feature. From a growing fashion movement to government initiatives to create a Silicon Valley of the South, there is an energy that just can't be suppressed. Long gone are the days when the city was derided for its food scene or seen as sleepy and staid. Arts sites like the Centro Gabriela Mistral, which opened in September, along with cutting-edge galleries, boutiques and stand-out restaurants, attest to an urban scene that has blossomed in the wake of a repressive dictatorship now long dead.
