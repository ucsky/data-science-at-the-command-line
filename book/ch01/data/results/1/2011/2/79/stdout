The bloodshed in the besieged town, Dara'a, was the worst episode on another violent Friday. At least 40 people were killed across the country, repeating a cycle that has become a fixture of the most serious challenge to the Assad family's four decades of dictatorial rule. For weeks, demonstrators have poured into the streets after noon prayers, only to face the determination of the government to disperse them, often with live ammunition.","abstract":"Syrian soldiers fire on protesters carrying olive branches and seeking to break the military siege of city of Dara'a, killing at least 16 people; thousands had taken to the streets in proclaimed 'Friday of Rage' against the government's crackdown; photo (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/04\/30\/world\/30syria-span\/30syria-span-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/04\/30\/world\/30syria-span\/30syria-span-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/04\/30\/world\/30syria-span\/30syria-span-articleLarge.jpg","height":315,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/04\/30\/world\/30syria-span\/30syria-span-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":315},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Syrian Forces Shoot at Protesters Trying to Break Siege of Town in 'Friday of Rage'"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ASSAD, BASHAR AL-"},{"name":"glocations","value":"DARA'A (SYRIA)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SYRIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA UNREST (2010- )"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEMONSTRATIONS, PROTESTS AND RIOTS"}],"pub_date":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Anthony","lastname":"SHADID"}],"original":"By ANTHONY SHADID; Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Lebanon; Matthew Saltmarsh from Geneva; Ranya Kadri from the Jordanian-Syrian border; and employees of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria, and Beirut"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29e5e8eb7c8105d880b57","word_count":1123},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/02\/chic-in-review-babies-and-ladies\/","snippet":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","lead_paragraph":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","abstract":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chic in Review | Babies and Ladies","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-02T15:10:30Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Kathryn","rank":1,"lastname":"BRANCH"}],"original":"By KATHRYN BRANCH"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a11d8eb7c8105d8e759a","word_count":528},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/10\/13\/fashion\/the-buzz-events-celebrate-films-executives-and-the-cosmos.html","snippet":"A preview of the must-attend parties, talked-about openings and fashionable night spots for the week ahead.","lead_paragraph":"A PREVIEW of the must-attend parties, talked-about openings and fashionable night spots for the week ahead.

His collection was called Human Laundry. \"He is an interdisciplinarian and renaissance man in the truest sense,\" Hanratty says. Vibskov also drums for the Danish electro outfit Trentemoller. His new unisex fragrance line, which will be introduced during New York Fashion Week, is called Type. \"It reflects geographical locale rather than specific mood,\" says Hanratty of the three scents, each called Type A, B and C. \"I knew, given his varied interests, that I would get a very atypical selection.\"","abstract":"This week's playlist - which the Jam's Sean Hanratty dubs \"atypical\" -- comes from the Danish fashion designer, Henrik Vibskov.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Jam | Henrik Vibskov","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-02T14:00:05Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Kathryn","rank":1,"lastname":"BRANCH"}],"original":"By KATHRYN BRANCH"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a0e48eb7c8105d8e6c90","word_count":179},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/11\/06\/movies\/homevideo\/new-dvds-laurel-and-hardy-the-essential-collection.html","snippet":"The comedy team Laurel and Hardy \u2014 in shorts, features, even foreign versions of their films \u2014 are reunited in a 10-disc set.","lead_paragraph":"The comedy team Laurel and Hardy \u2014 in shorts, features, even foreign versions of their films \u2014 are reunited in a 10-disc set.","abstract":"Dave Kehr reviews DVD box set Laurel and Hardy: The Essential Collection, produced by RHI Entertainment.","print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/11\/06\/arts\/06KEHR_SPAN\/06KEHR1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","height":352,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2011\/11\/06\/arts\/06KEHR_SPAN\/06KEHR1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"352"},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"thumbnail","url":"images\/2011\/11\/06\/arts\/06KEHR_SPAN\/06KEHR1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"width":75,"legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2011\/11\/06\/arts\/06KEHR_SPAN\/06KEHR1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"New DVDs: \u2018Laurel and Hardy: The Essential Collection\u2019","main":"Another Nice Set We\u2019re In, Stanley","kicker":"DVD","print_headline":"Another Nice Set We\u2019re In, Stanley"},"keywords":[{"value":"Video Recordings and Downloads","is_major":"Y","rank":"5","name":"subject"},{"value":"Movies","is_major":"Y","rank":"1","name":"subject"},{"value":"Laurel, Stan","is_major":"N","rank":"3","name":"persons"},{"value":"DVD (Digital Versatile Disc)","is_major":"N","rank":"2","name":"subject"},{"value":"Hardy, Oliver","is_major":"N","rank":"4","name":"persons"}],"pub_date":"2011-11-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts&Leisure","section_name":"Movies","subsection_name":"DVD","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Dave","lastname":"KEHR"}],"original":"By DAVE KEHR"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"515b8db2fdc59278db00c6af","word_count":"1492"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/12\/02\/chic-in-review-365-days-of-lady-gaga\/","snippet":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","lead_paragraph":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","abstract":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chic in Review | 365 Days of Lady Gaga","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-12-02T19:30:13Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Kathryn","rank":1,"lastname":"BRANCH"}],"original":"By KATHRYN BRANCH"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a2b18eb7c8105d8eaef0","word_count":448},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9906E4DF143FF93BA2575AC0A9679D8B63","snippet":"New York Fashion Week ended last Thursday after more than 250 designers presented looks for spring 2012, each hoping to be the one to redefine the language of fashion.

Watching the shows, I kept thinking of Melissa Kuba Lederer, left and right, a woman I often see on her way to work. To me, her daily interpretation of men's wear triumphed over all the designer dreams, poetic as many were. Ms. Lederer's sleek style has the look of the future. And I thought of men I see en route to the office who, through small details, subtlely inserted their own personalities into the conventional suit, like James Aguiar, bottom row, left, and Andrew Mukamal, bottom row, right. Certainly, as Chanel knew when she slipped into the clothes of her lovers, man-tailoring can be terrific on women. And Ralph Lauren knows it, too. At his show, top row, he harked back to the Gar\u00e7onne look of the 1920s to dress today's women for serious careers. Of course, there is room for the glorious kaleidoscopic diversity of designer visions shown last week on the runways. But then again, I can't tell you how many women pulled me aside during Fashion Week and said, ''Beautiful clothes, Bill, but nothing to wear.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Reality Check","kicker":"ON THE STREET"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-09-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"CUNNINGHAM"}],"original":"By BILL CUNNINGHAM"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a2878eb7c8105d887ab2","word_count":260},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/02\/10\/video-exclusive-shirin-neshat-models-for-ohne-titel\/","snippet":"In this exclusive video, Neshat, who features in a lot of her photographs and films, talks about her turn in front of the camera for someone else.","lead_paragraph":"Flora Gill and Alexa Adams named their label Ohne Titel (German for \"no title\") after Anselm Kiefer, the German artist who frequently left his works untitled and who inspired their first collection in 2007.
