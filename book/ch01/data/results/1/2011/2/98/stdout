(13) ARMADILLO (2011) Janus Metz follows a platoon of Danish soldiers through Helmand Province in Afghanistan in a film that has a lot in common with ''Restrepo,'' the war documentary by Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. As in ''Restrepo,'' he said, the men's ''sincere devotion to duty, and their interest in making a difference in an unfortunate part of the world, is challenged by a pervasive sense of the enterprise's difficulty.'' Despite enormous technological advantages, ''the mutual incomprehension of these men and the Afghans they're helping -- who may or may not be the same people they're fighting -- seems almost intractable. And the soldiers' frustration proves explosive.'' An intense firefight and its bloody aftermath turns the film ''into a queasy ethical puzzle,'' Mr. Scott said. ''What happens is shocking, and yet it also seems, especially to the soldiers, completely logical and acceptable. It is certainly possible to believe otherwise, but the achievement of this film is to forestall and complicate easy judgment. You emerge shaken and bothered, which may sound like a reason not to see the movie. It is actually the opposite.'' 2:20 P.M. (Cinemax) THE INFORMANT! (2009) In Steven Soderbergh's retelling of a real-life whodunit reported in a book (and for The New York Times) by Kurt Eichenwald, Matt Damon, above, adds some pounds and a prosthetic nose to play Mark Whitacre, a biochemist and Archer Daniels Midland executive who informs on his company's involvement in a global price-fixing scheme. Scott Bakula and Joel McHale are the F.B.I. agents who become so protective of Whitacre that they carry around a picture of his family after wiring up his body and briefcase. ''Like all of Mr. Soderbergh's movies, this one can be appreciated on purely formal terms, for the clarity of its images and the economy of the storytelling,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times. ''But it is Mr. Soderbergh's insistence on seeing the A.D.M. scandal as a collective tragedy rather than as another white-collar crime that gives the movie force, resonance, feeling. In the face of such corruption perhaps only laughter will do: after all, for a while now the joke has most definitely been on us.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-08-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kathryn","lastname":"SHATTUCK"}],"original":"By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"4fd292618eb7c8105d86b3cc","word_count":755},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/07\/31\/fashion\/weddings\/arnold-scaasi-and-parker-ladd-50-years-together-and-more-to-come.html","snippet":"Arnold Scaasi and Parker Ladd said the judge was absent, but they had sought to make their marriage vows, after 50 years together.","lead_paragraph":"ARNOLD SCAASI was once asked by a writer for The Times whether, should same-sex marriage become legal, he would wed his partner, Parker Ladd.
