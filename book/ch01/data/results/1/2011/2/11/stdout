With the help of the stylist Alastair McKimm and the producer and set designer Alexandre de Betak, the duo achieved exactly the effect they were going for: a dramatic show referencing 90s minimalism (a nod to the original Helmut Lang look) set against a backdrop so raw it magnified the collection's softness, something that the Colovoses have bestowed upon the label since taking over in 2007. \"We've always explored contrasts in texture and fabric,\" Ms. Colovos said. And there were billowy silk trousers, asymmetrical handkerchief dresses and washed leather jackets paired back to single-shoulder-strap sports bras and made-for-stomping platforms designed by Alejandro Ingelmo to prove that. For McKimm, who created the look, the biggest challenge was editing the collection, and he did so by forgoing a pink story and a print, using only a selection of canary-yellow pieces to pop amongst all the black and white. As for the venue, de Betak was dead set on using an open space that had not been touched too much; the less pomp and circumstance, the better. The final stage, a square platform perched high above the ground, lent gravitas to the exceptionally strong clothes it carried.","abstract":"An exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the label's first runway show in more than five years.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Making of the Helmut Lang Show","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"4","name":"subject","value":"Fashion and Apparel"},{"rank":"3","name":"persons","value":"Lang, Helmut"},{"rank":"2","name":"persons","value":"Ingelmo, Alejandro"},{"rank":"5","name":"subject","value":"New York Fashion Week"},{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"},{"rank":"6","name":"subject","value":"Trade Shows and Fairs"},{"rank":"7","name":"glocations","value":"Manhattan (NYC)"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-10T20:30:30Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Lily","rank":1,"lastname":"HARRISON"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By LILY HARRISON and IOULEX"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a1338eb7c8105d8e7913","word_count":237},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/02\/15\/scorecard-update-marc-jacobs\/","snippet":"The fashion critics weigh in on the Marc Jacobs Fall 2011 runway show at New York Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"Marc JacobsDesigner: Marc JacobsDate and Location: Monday, Feb. 14, New York State Armory, 68 Lexington AvenuePhotos: slide show","abstract":"The fashion critics weigh in on the Marc Jacobs Fall 2011 runway show at New York Fashion Week.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Scorecard Update | Marc Jacobs","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"4","name":"subject","value":"New York Fashion Week"},{"rank":"3","name":"subject","value":"Fashion and Apparel"},{"rank":"2","name":"persons","value":"Jacobs, Marc"},{"rank":"5","name":"subject","value":"Trade Shows and Fairs"},{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"},{"rank":"6","name":"organizations","value":"Daily Mail"},{"rank":"7","name":"organizations","value":"Daily Telegraph"},{"rank":"8","name":"organizations","value":"International Herald Tribune"},{"rank":"9","name":"organizations","value":"Style.com"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-15T14:18:09Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Alison","middlename":"S.","lastname":"COHN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By ALISON S.
