A runway show was all about the clothes. ''It was all about names like Calvin, Donna, Ralph, Giorgio and Gianni.'' Actually in the late '80s, most models did their own makeup. But a decade later, Mr. Espinet said in his unmistakable Trinidadian accent, designers ''wanted a specific makeup artist who told a story about how the makeup tied to the fashion, and they wanted a celebrity hairstylist who told a story.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/09\/08\/fashion\/08SKIN1\/08SKIN1-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/09\/08\/fashion\/08SKIN1\/08SKIN1-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/09\/08\/fashion\/08SKIN1\/08SKIN1-articleLarge.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/09\/08\/fashion\/08SKIN1\/08SKIN1-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"The Emerging Face Behind the Faces","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK | SKIN DEEP"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"COSMETICS AND TOILETRIES"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Catherine","middlename":"Saint","lastname":"LOUIS","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd294568eb7c8105d86edf5","word_count":1281},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/15\/fashion\/extra-extra-papers-event-planning-affiliate-ny-fashion-week.html","snippet":"Extra Extra, a burgeoning event-planning and branding affiliate of Paper magazine, plans hip events for brands on the fringes of cool.","lead_paragraph":"IF you are Nine West, a mainstream shoe and accessories company with mall stores in places like Monroe, Ohio; and McAllen, Tex.; staging a party for a new line during New York Fashion Week can be something of a challenge.

It's about a bulimic girl obsessed with perfection, poise and control who is really -- really! -- dying for her breakout moment at Lincoln Center so the world can see how talented she is. Of course, the film is set next door at a fictional ballet company, and the girl is trying to break out of the corps, not the fashion pack. But every year, as the fashion flock gets larger, it's harder to spot the cob or pen -- boy swan or girl swan, of course -- that could rise above the rest, on track to a spotlight in Vogue, a C.F.D.A. nomination and an order from Bergdorf Goodman. What makes this season special, though, is that, unlike past years when fashion's searchlights were focused on a crop of 23-year-olds just out Parsons (and 12-year-olds were declaring themselves designers), four of the most anticipated collections are by designers who each have more than a decade of experience and come to their new lines with a track record of making great, desirable clothes.","abstract":"Showcase of some anticipated collections from several well-known designers at New York Fashion Week; photos (M)","print_page":"17","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/02\/10\/fashion\/10WATCH-span\/Z-SUB-WATCH-A-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/02\/10\/fashion\/10WATCH-span\/Z-SUB-WATCH-A-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/02\/10\/fashion\/10WATCH-span\/Z-SUB-WATCH-A-articleLarge.jpg","height":306,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/02\/10\/fashion\/10WATCH-span\/Z-SUB-WATCH-A-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":306},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"All Eyes on 4 Not-So-New Designers","kicker":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"THEYSKENS, OLIVIER"},{"name":"organizations","value":"LINCOLN CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"David","lastname":"COLMAN"}],"original":"By DAVID COLMAN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd28a318eb7c8105d85c84b","word_count":852},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/02\/24\/fashion\/24ROW.html","snippet":"Variations of varsity jackets appeared in the collections of Thom Browne, Phillip Lim, Patrik Ervell, Wayne Lee, Rag & Bone, Peter Som and Calvin Klein.","lead_paragraph":"VARSITY jackets are having a moment, evidently.
