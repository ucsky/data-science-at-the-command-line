Looking back at what truly resonated with audiences outside of the fashion elite, it is tough to think of anything more substantial than the hullabaloo that took place this summer over a single dress -- one that hardly anyone had a chance to get a good look at. That, of course, was the white strapless beaded wedding gown worn by Chelsea Clinton at a top-secret ceremony in Rhinebeck, N.Y., on July 31. As it happened, it was a dress by Vera Wang, seen by the public in only a handful of official portraits released by the Clinton family. The dress had some silvery belt thing at the waist and a very tight fitted bodice, and what looked like a rushing waterfall of tulle below the waist. To no small degree of dissatisfaction among the fashion press, Ms. Clinton's gown was not destined to be hugely influential in the tradition of bridal gowns worn by glamorous members of prominent political or royal families (i.e., Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, Princess Diana, Ivanka Trump). But frankly, she could have worn burlap and remained at the top of this list, since half the fun was in all the anticipation and speculation. You can only imagine what 2011 has in store for Kate Middleton. 2. As a whole, the spring collections shown by designers in September and October represented one of the best fashion seasons in years. Bravo, designers. Of the more than 500 shows, however, my pick for the most outstanding goes to Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel, who transformed the Grand Palais into a marvelous black-and-white garden of pebbles, terraces and fountains right out of ''Last Year at Marienbad.'' The collection, with lightweight tweeds and feathery dresses, did not veer substantially from Mr. Lagerfeld's usual territory, but it did seem more personally connected to the women (and men) who modeled the clothes. It is difficult to convey just how well they played against the enormous scale of this stage, other than to say that it felt as if, rather than merely witnessing Mr. Lagerfeld's vision, one had entered it.","abstract":"Eric Wilson lists his most top ten important fashion moments in 2010; photos (M)","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/01\/02\/fashion\/02fashion-span\/02fashion-span-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/01\/02\/fashion\/02fashion-span\/02fashion-span-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/01\/02\/fashion\/02fashion-span\/02fashion-span-articleLarge.jpg","height":300,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/01\/02\/fashion\/02fashion-span\/02fashion-span-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":300},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Key Fashion Moments of 2010: A new home for New York Fashion Week, and the sartorial stars of 'The Social Network.'","kicker":"THE YEAR IN STYLE"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TWO THOUSAND TEN (YEAR)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-01-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"WILSON"}],"original":"By ERIC WILSON"},"type_of_material":"List","_id":"4fd285598eb7c8105d8557e3","word_count":893},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/06\/30\/fashion\/fashion-review-spring-mens-wear-collections-in-paris.html","snippet":"Top collections, from Givenchy and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, turn their backs on the sobriety seen elsewhere.","lead_paragraph":"PARIS -- MAYBE it's too many hours on Twitter that causes people to reduce fashion shows to a check-off list of essentials, but whatever it is, writers at the spring men's collections here were ticking the appropriate boxes: globalism, gender games, the new sobriety.
