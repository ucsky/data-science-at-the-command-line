We need the turquoise trousers for the show.'\" By accident, Westman had selected a look that made it into the final collection, instead of an edit, to wear today, a mistake that was quickly corrected. \"It's the strongest Spring, yet,\" she said explaining her excitement at the '70s surf vacation and 90s rave culture-inspired pieces. She chose a minimal makeup look, so as not to compete with the bright colors of the clothes. Eyes were simply taupe Revlon 16H shadow in Addictive with a touch of Sueded Brow liner. Cheeks were tinted with a light bronzer and blush in Tawny Peach while lips were pale pink, coated with shine and patted with powder. \"Personally, I don't think lip gloss is cool.\" What is cool-- and consistently Rag & Bone-- appears to be grey nails. Jin Soon Choi took last season's slate to a lighter shade of concrete- Revlon's Smoky Canvas or Hazy. As for hair, Guido Palau admitted the idea was \"effortless,\" though the process was anything but. \"Eighty percent of the New York designers want ease. It always looks glamorous,\" he said. To achieve this, Palau tightly braided the underside of the models' hair and then added extensions for length to create the illusion of fineness. He then used Redken Satinwear all over damp hair which he dried with a Mason Pearson brush and Sultra tools. The hair was then clamped at the neck with a Velcro strap to create a bob-like effect. Ah, this explains the rave reference.","abstract":"Gucci Westman and Guido Palau discuss hair and makeup with the Moment.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Backstage Beauty Report | Rag & Bone","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-10T13:00:24Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stephanie","rank":1,"lastname":"LA CAVA"}],"original":"By STEPHANIE LA CAVA"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a0fc8eb7c8105d8e700f","word_count":297},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/01\/13\/fashion\/13scene.html","snippet":"Massimo Vignelli, the graphic designer known for his 1972 New York City subway map, among other iconic designs, turns 80.","lead_paragraph":"THE invitation was in Helvetica.
