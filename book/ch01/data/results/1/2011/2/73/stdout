Making her New York Fashion Week debut at the recent Gen Art show, a group runway that spotlights emerging designers, Chun presented spring looks that elegantly mix fashion's masculine and feminine. \"I definitely wouldn't say they're androgynous. They aren't literal interpretations of men's pieces,\" she explains. \"You don't want it to become too costumey. I'm more interested in functionality.\" In Chun's gender blender, a khaki boyfriend blazer is paired with a cropped top; a long, creamy silk dress bears a baseball raglan. Everything appears to be designed for women who don't spend all day planning outfits. \"This is for a city girl,\" she says. \"I never leave the house without a blazer, without a trench coat - so those will be my signatures.\"","abstract":"In Chun's gender blender, a khaki boyfriend blazer is paired with a cropped top; a long, creamy silk dress bears a baseball raglan.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"New Designer Alert | Jennifer Chun","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:04Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alex","rank":1,"lastname":"FRANK"}],"original":"By ALEX FRANK"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a10c8eb7c8105d8e73fa","word_count":189},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B03E1D61E3CF934A2575AC0A9679D8B63","snippet":"Because of an editing error, a picture caption last Saturday with the Nocturnalist column, about a New York Fashion Week event that brought together skateboaders and the fashion industry, misstated, in some editions, the name of the bar in the Time...","lead_paragraph":"Because of an editing error, a picture caption last Saturday with the Nocturnalist column, about a New York Fashion Week event that brought together skateboaders and the fashion industry, misstated, in some editions, the name of the bar in the Time Warner Center where the skateboarders performed.
