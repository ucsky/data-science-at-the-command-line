Her schedule is such that it takes a few weeks to get a 10-minute phone call penciled in, and even then, when a time is agreed upon, her New York agent calls the day of to say she's a little tied up - scrambling around searching for her passport. (It's probably under a heap of clothes somewhere in her Lower East Side apartment.) But it's hard not to forgive her. She's only 20 after all, and isn't that what all 20-year-olds do? Lose their passports. Except most don't have to fly to Paris at dawn for a round of couture shows. Aldridge, who has catwalked for Prada, Gucci, Dior, Proenza Schouler and Miu Miu, starred in last year's Marc by Marc Jacobs campaign and is one of the new faces of Valentino, is having a moment. This shouldn't come as any surprise to the British, who have always had a fondness for the Aldridges: her mother is Laura Lyons, an American model and former Playboy Playmate, and her father is the famous English illustrator Alan Aldridge, whom Ruby describes as the love of her life. ''He's the best, and just the most amazing, creative, modest genius I ever met,'' she gushes. You might have seen his cartoony, psychedelic artwork in books for the Beatles and on album covers for the Rolling Stones, the Who and Elton John. Ruby is fortunate to have inherited good looks and a creative spirit (she's currently learning to play guitar) in equal measures, as have all the Aldridge offspring.","abstract":null,"print_page":"82","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Runaround Ruby"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-10-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Women's Fashion Magazine","section_name":"Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Sarah","lastname":"HARRIS"}],"original":"By SARAH HARRIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd297c58eb7c8105d873e45","word_count":475},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9501E0D7173DF930A15750C0A9679D8B63","snippet":"5:04 p.m. | Updated One hundred years after the Triangle Waist Company fire, the fashion that employed small armies of seamstresses at the turn of the last century endures.
