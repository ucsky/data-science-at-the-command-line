Marc Jacobs has heard it all. And he has absorbed it all with a hard-won equanimity. ''You can live with the love, you can live with the hate,'' Mr. Jacobs said the other day at his office in SoHo. He had placed his arms squarely on a wooden conference table so nondescript it might have been salvaged from a high school's teacher's lounge. ''We've been bankrupt, we been fired,'' he said.

This was some while ago, a century or so. But up until World War II and the period just after, a gentleman was not considered properly dressed without a hat. Even the names of hats were rich in character and historical association. The bowler, or derby, with the rigid shape of an upended bean pot, was named for a 19th-century English earl who popularized the style. The fedora's name came from a play of that title, written for Sarah Bernhardt by the otherwise largely forgotten French dramatist Victorien Sardou. Then the hat went the way of the dodo. Social historians are divided about the cause of the sartorial die-off, although an often repeated canard attributes it to President Kennedy and his rarely covered thatch of luxuriant hair. The real blame probably belongs to automobiles, though. Hats were knocked off when you entered a car and inevitably got squashed beneath a passenger's wayward behind or went into orbit when you lowered the top to a convertible.","abstract":"Hats are latest trend at men's fashion shows in Milan and Paris; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/02\/03\/fashion\/03HATS-span\/Z-P1-HATS-B-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/02\/03\/fashion\/03HATS-span\/Z-P1-HATS-B-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/02\/03\/fashion\/03HATS-span\/Z-P1-HATS-B-articleLarge.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/02\/03\/fashion\/03HATS-span\/Z-P1-HATS-B-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back","kicker":"CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MEN AND BOYS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILAN FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"HATS AND CAPS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARIS FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-02-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Guy","lastname":"TREBAY"}],"original":"By GUY TREBAY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2899f8eb7c8105d85b86a","word_count":1197},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/09\/07\/all-fashion-all-the-time\/","snippet":"The Fashion and Style department of The New York Times will have wall-to-wall coverage of all the key Fashion Week events between now and Sept. 16.","lead_paragraph":"Thursday marks the official start of Fashion Week, with more than 250 designers showing their spring 2012 collections at dozens of locations around the city, including Lincoln Center, now in its third season as home of Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week.","abstract":"The Fashion and Style department of The New York Times will have wall-to-wall coverage of all the key Fashion Week events between now and Sept. 16.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"All Fashion, All the Time","kicker":"On the Runway"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-07T20:03:17Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stuart","rank":1,"lastname":"EMMRICH"}],"original":"By STUART EMMRICH"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a0dd8eb7c8105d8e6ad2","word_count":303},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/11\/18\/fashion-without-end\/","snippet":"It's clear that one could board a plane after the Paris ready-to-wear shows and keep going, traveling to the various fashion weeks around the world.","lead_paragraph":"It's clear that one could board a plane after the Paris ready-to-wear shows and keep going, traveling to the various fashion weeks around the world.
