Last year, he created a short film for Chanel's Web site, called ''Remember Now,'' and this year he is following up with a 30-minute movie called ''The Tale of a Fairy.'' On Thursday, Mr. Lagerfeld introduced a series of commercials, which he billed as an ''original film series,'' at a party in Chelsea as part of the Tribeca Film Festival. They will be shown at some of the screenings next week. The American actress Rachel Bilson (most notably of ''The O.C.'') appears in each commercial, portraying a fashion model, an art student and a ballet dancer. For whatever reason, each of those characters ends up eating an ice cream bar.
