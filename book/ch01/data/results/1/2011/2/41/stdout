Actually, Mr. Tait is Canadian, educated in Montreal. In 2010, he completed the master's program at Central Saint Martins in London, whereupon he joined that race known as the Young Designer. He is 24. His spring collection was a favorite of mine. The lines were fairly simple, but he added color (baby pink and green) and turned a screen-printed silk jersey into micro-pleated trousers or panels for dresses. He used a traditional technique in a fresh way. Mr. Tait's clothes are sold at Louis Boston and Blake in Chicago.

Yet with the 50th anniversary of Ms. Monroe's mysterious death approaching, her image is experiencing something of a cultural moment, even by ageless icon standards. Suddenly Marilyn is everywhere. For starters, there is the October cover of Vogue (below). Actually that is Michelle Williams, who is staring in a biopic, ''My Week With Marilyn,'' due out Nov. 4, and who posed as Monroe's likeness in an Annie Leibovitz photo series for the magazine. Then there is ''Marilyn: Intimate Exposures,'' a book by Susan Bernard, featuring unpublished photos by her father, Bruno (of billowing-skirt-shot fame), to be released Oct. 4. In February, a new NBC series, ''Smash,'' about a fictional Monroe-themed Broadway musical, will make its debut.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/09\/25\/fashion\/25NOTICED\/25NOTICED-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/09\/25\/fashion\/25NOTICED\/25NOTICED-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"A Marilyn Obsession","kicker":"NOTICED"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MONROE, MARILYN"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2011-09-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Austin","lastname":"CONSIDINE"}],"original":"By AUSTIN CONSIDINE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd292658eb7c8105d86b6f7","word_count":507},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9E07E4DC173BF932A25751C1A9679D8B63","snippet":"FOR the last few days I've been in London on assignment, staying at the Portobello Hotel, where -- my friend Tim Blanks tells me -- he used to visit Nico in the '70s.

''It may have been the first boutique hotel in London,'' he said, recalling that the front-desk man in the Nico era wore a cropped Vivienne Westwood top with feather trim. To me, the Portobello, in Notting Hill, is actually the un-boutique hotel. It doesn't charge for Wi-Fi, and you can get porridge any time you want it. Somebody in the management thought to add a small carton of milk to the familiar bottles in the mini bar (with a cereal bowl in the cupboard). In other words, the hotel gives you exactly what you need, and doesn't try to be stylish or hip. It just is.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn reports from London on the country's fashion scene; praises the Duchess of Cambridge, who wore a $100 Zara dress to a benefit concert, for her frugal approach to fashion at a time when England is suffering from major economic woes.
