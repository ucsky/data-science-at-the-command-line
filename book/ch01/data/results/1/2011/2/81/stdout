It's likely that most fans, including the stylist Brad Goreski (above left), are attracted to the unisex bags because of their fluorescent colors and friendly prices (around $150 to $250), but the bags' back story is good, too. Upon learning that her daughter was being bullied, Julie Deane, in Cambridge, England, set out to earn the money to send her children to private school. Reading the Harry Potter books with her family, she drew upon the bags that Harry and friends carried at Hogwarts. She made samples, bloggers got wind, and now she has a multimillion-dollar business, and starlets, like the enchanting Elle Fanning (right), toting her bags. They are available at cambridgesatchel.com, with custom embossing, if you like, and come November they will be at Bloomingdale's. P.S.: The kids are in private school.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Like Harry's at Hogwarts","kicker":"BROWSING | NOTICED"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-10-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By ERICA M.

Elettra Wiedemann, a model and a food activist, hopes to change that by opening Goodness, a pop-up restaurant installed at Ed's Chowder House across the street from Lincoln Center. From Sunday through Sept. 14, Goodness will serve locally sourced food from some of the city's best toques, including Nick Wilbur from the Fat Radish and Christopher Rendell of ''Iron Chef.''

Not really, though to gaze at the latest round of runway shows, you might think so. In New York, and in Milan this week, designers embraced the primly corseted silhouettes of the American midcentury with an extravagant fervor. Their outpouring of springtime sheaths, cocktail frocks, camp shirts and circle skirts, all emblems of late 1950s bourgeois chic, seemed worthy at times of Suzy Parker, their collections like outtakes from a Slim Aarons shoot. Fashion's rekindled infatuation with Modernism, expressed by talents like Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler and Consuelo Castiglioni of Marni, seems familiar in more ways than one. This is not, after all, the first time designers have revisited the prosperous postwar era to conjure a feeling of stability, one expected to resonate with anxious consumers. Reviving a period enriched by material comforts as substantial as a Steuben crystal bowl also represents a long-overdue return to old-fashioned concepts of quality.","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Once Again, They Like Ike","kicker":"TRENDSPOTTING"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-09-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a2898eb7c8105d887cc5","word_count":304},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/01\/17\/video-exclusive-gang-gang-dance-and-jules-marquis\/","snippet":"Check out a sneak peek at Gang Gang's coming album via a new video by Jules Marquis, set inside a Macy's department store.","lead_paragraph":"New York favorites Gang Gang Dance will release their highly anticipated (at least by the art-rock set) fifth album this spring on the 4AD label. As the band gears up for the big date, it is planning a slew of shows, among them tonight's private after-party for Capsule, a hip-enough fashion trade show held regularly in New York. Curated by Sean Hanratty, the night's bill includes Light Asylum as an opening act and a video installation by the artists Daniel Turner and Colin Snapp. The two recently began collaborating under the name Jules Marquis; this past December they debuted their joint work with a well-received show at the Martos Gallery in Chelsea.
