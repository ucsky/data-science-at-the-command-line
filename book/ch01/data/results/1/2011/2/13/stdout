BCBG, Diane Von Furstenberg and Reed Krakoff -- Michelle Smith, the designer for Milly, chose color. In an interview backstage, she described her collection as young and fresh (as well as other marketable keywords). Romy Soleimani of the MAC Pro Team created a bright pink lipstick to accompany the geometric prints in the collection. She mixed MAC's white and fuchsia lip color. From a distance, the pink looks very similar to the popular matte summer pink that a lot of women, especially young women, have been wearing the last few seasons. But close up, the pink has more of an opaque base and looks like a mix of Pepto-Bismol and neon pinks.","abstract":"While some designers went for soft beauty looks this season, Michelle Smith, the
