''Then you have a gym wig -- a gym wig and a Target wig are the same thing -- and the ones I wear to the mall on the weekend with my family.'' There is what she calls an ''airport-schlepping wig'' and a shorter one she reserves for days out with her son, Kevin, 8. ''You can't be flinging long fake hair around at a birthday party,'' she said with a deep laugh.

But the death of Natasha Richardson last week, after a skiing accident in Canada, struck many with particular force because Ms. Richardson was not merely a well-known actress but also a member of a great British theatrical dynasty. Talent often runs in the blood, and there is certainly no shortage of actors who beget actors. In New York this spring, you could see second-generation talent in abundance onstage, with the daughters of Meryl Streep, Jill Clayburgh and Phylicia Rashad, as well as the son of Tom Hanks, giving notable performances on Broadway and off. They join a long list of performers who have drawn from the wellspring of their DNA to forge careers in movies or theater. In some cases -- I'll name no names -- it seems merely a matter of capitalizing on and then coasting on the access afforded by being the son or daughter of a star. But there is unquestionably a gene for performing that can either be developed or lie dormant.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/03\/22\/weekinreview\/22isher.751.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/03\/22\/weekinreview\/22isher.751.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/03\/22\/weekinreview\/22isher.large1.jpg","height":651,"width":500,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":500,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/03\/22\/weekinreview\/22isher.large1.jpg","xlargeheight":651},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Alone On This Stage: Redgraves","kicker":"CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REDGRAVE, VANESSA"},{"name":"persons","value":"REDGRAVE, MICHAEL"},{"name":"persons","value":"RICHARDSON, TONY"},{"name":"persons","value":"REDGRAVE, CORIN"},{"name":"persons","value":"RICHARDSON, JOELY"},{"name":"persons","value":"REDGRAVE, JEMMA"},{"name":"persons","value":"RICHARDSON, NATASHA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACTORS AND ACTRESSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"FAMILIES AND FAMILY LIFE"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"2009-03-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Theater; Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Charles","lastname":"ISHERWOOD"}],"original":"By CHARLES ISHERWOOD"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29b7d8eb7c8105d87b317","word_count":1031},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/09\/07\/us\/politics\/07obama.html","snippet":"With the White House on the defensive, President Obama will seek to reassert command of the health care debate.","lead_paragraph":"President Obama returned to the White House from his summer break on Sunday determined to jump-start his struggling presidency by reasserting command of the health care debate and recalibrating expectations that some advisers believe got away from him.
