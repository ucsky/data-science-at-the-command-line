This week, he kisses and tells about a lip gloss kissing wall.By the time I arrived at \"XOXO,\" a strange event celebrating love and the launch of four new shades of Kiehl's lip gloss, the lip gloss was gone. \"These women,\" said a beleaguered PR flack, \"they've got no self-control.\" But one can hardly blame the assembled crowd of fashionable girls and their gay boyfriends from rushing to begloss their lips in shades like East Village Vibe, a milk-chocolate hue, and Lights on Broadway, a slightly rosier gradation. The party had promised a \"kissing wall\" and a \"D.J. from France.\" This was, after all, fashion week, when parties must sell themselves hard. Lip gloss isn't enough. But, sighed Joanna Virello, a PR rep for IC LAB, the host of the evening, the idea of a kissing wall was nixed: \"They said it was unsanitary.\" Instead there were pictures of puckering models on the walls. But there was a D.J. from France. His name was Edouard, and he had just flown in from Bordeaux, where he works as a banker. A lonely pucker mark - in New York Nude, a medium \"sand dune\" tone - on the wall proved the existence of at least one woman who wouldn't let hygiene ruin her night.","abstract":"Beauty Call reporter Joshua David Stein goes where no man has gone before: to beauty press events.

The retailer was pep-talking his staff moments before the doors were flung open to the hordes lined up on Broadway for the long-delayed opening of Topshop's first American store, a 25,000-square-foot emporium in SoHo.

(HBO) CHINA'S UNNATURAL DISASTER: THE TEARS OF SICHUAN PROVINCE On May 12, 2008, some 10,000 children were among the 70,000 who died when an earthquake hit Sichaun Province in China. Entire classrooms of boys and girls were killed when poorly constructed schools collapsed. This documentary from Jon Alpert and Matthew O'Neill (the Emmy Award-winning ''Baghdad ER'') examines the earthquake's devastating toll and watches as anguished parents, like those above, grow outraged at officials who oversaw the schools' construction and at the government that focused its rescue efforts elsewhere. One mother says, ''This is a lesson of blood.'' 7 A.M.

New Yorkers are less jet-set than usual these days, so the grungy transportation hub may be the best place to catch them on the move. For \"Design to Go,\" the second temporary event in the new Blank SL8 exhibition space (sponsored by the Times Square Alliance and the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, with the Port Auhority), at 41st Street and Eighth Avenue, the Brooklyn designer Kiel Mead -- seen in the video above setting up the store last week -- helped Areaware curate a selection of products from New York stores and makers. There will be something for commuters of all stripes: folks heading to Montauk can pick up a Strida folding bike to ride to the beach, while those bound for Maine may select an Audubon Bird Call from Kiosk and a KOR One water bottle. Going upstate? Take a graffiti-themed puzzle by the artist Julian Hibbard and a copy of the Brooklyn literary magazine Soon Quarterly for the ride. And for those stuck spending weekends in the city, chase a snarky coffee mug from the Future Perfect with Salvor's ironic take on the I Heart NY T-shirt, then pick up one of Wayne Heller's luggage tags for American Design Club in hopes things will turn around by fall. The shop is open through Sept. 26.","abstract":"It's fitting, really, that Areaware, the local design company, is opening a pop-up travel shop today inside the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
