Fall, on the other hand, is the industry's serious season, when the studios trot out the kind of aesthetically ambitious, modestly priced work that dominates Top 10 lists and tends to clean up at the Oscars. In the last two years, however, several studios have shut down or absorbed the specialty divisions that provided them with some of their most critically praised titles, films like ''Good Night, and Good Luck'' and ''There Will Be Blood.'' Financing has dried up as the economy has gone sour, and even well-regarded films have struggled to turn a profit.
