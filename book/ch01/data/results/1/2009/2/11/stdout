The first two, one could argue, represent a return to optimism by those designers who are holding out hope that stocks really do rise with hemlines. The third is bit of a mystery. Or, as Linda Wells, the editor of Allure, put it last week in a video interview, ''perfectly insane.''

At nearly every presentation, tea and sympathy abound.","abstract":"If the general mood during New York fashion week left everyone secretly wishing that the free supply of Smart Water had only been laced with Xanax, London fashion week, by comparison, is an almost cheery affair. At nearly every presentation, tea and sympathy abound.Take the Topshop Venue, which has gone from a concept space to promote the talents of young designers to the de facto fashion week headquarters. London's best and brokest all show here -- Marios Schwab, Christopher Kane, Richard Nicoll, Danielle Scutt, Louise Goldin -- making the British Fashion Council tent pretty much 100 percent avoidable. (Let's not dwell on the irony of the tent's location at the National History Museum.) Once you navigate the hullabaloo at the door, followed by a steep hill that feels like a loading dock, you are immediately greeted by a flurry of young waiters serving soup, Champagne (the Brits start bright and early at 10 a.m.), tea, dessert, fruit smoothies, you name it. At the Marios Schwab show today, curried parsnip soup was being passed around (I saw Daphne Guinness politely decline a cup offered to her from the front row); at Christopher Kane, it was carrot and coriander (perhaps chosen for the nice alliteration?). If soup does not offer adequate comfort, the Topshop Venue also features a cafe with an open bar that runs all day. Meanwhile, at the Nathan Jenden show, held off-site at a stately English manor, waiters literally shoved tea cakes in your face. To say no to them just felt rude.Snacks aside, all this cheeriness gives the impression that the shows in London this season are more about offering moral support to a creative community -- one that has been known to limp along even in flush times -- than they are about catering to the whims of the fashion press or store buyers. And anyway, with so many street-fashion photographers crowding the sidewalks outside every show, it's fair to say that the blog-ready outfits worn by the guests might ultimately wield more influence than anything that we've seen on the runway. The young fashion writer Yu Masui, known for outlandish outfits that usually involve a coveted piece of women's Balenciaga or Margiela, is always seated front row, where he innocently commands the attention of the paparazzi. In fact, Masui has been to more shows than the usual flock of blue-chip critics, buyers and editors. (O.K., not more than Kanye.)","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"London Fashion Week | Positive Thinking","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-02-23T18:20:25Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alex","rank":1,"lastname":"HAWGOOD"}],"original":"By ALEX HAWGOOD"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd394478eb7c8105d8c914a","word_count":466},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/05\/04\/aussie-posse-australian-fashion-week-roundup\/","snippet":"With the Global Financial Crisis prompting the closure of one of its three venues, Australian Fashion Week was only a two-ring circus this season.
