Leyendecker was among the leading illustrators of his day, a darling of influential advertisers and publishers, including The Saturday Evening Post, a real media heavyweight circulating two million copies a week at its height.

Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis likened reviewing the movie to writing about the new packaging of a laundry detergent: the box may look different, but the stuff inside is pretty much the same. ''And in this case,'' she wrote, ''the stuff inside consists of exactly what most Hollywood movies based on old sitcoms are made of, namely feeble and funny jokes, brand actors and enough special effects to give you some bang for your summertime buck.''

He broke the previous record by three days and also became the first sailor to win the Vend\u00e9e twice. The only American in the race, Rich Wilson, who at 58 is also the oldest sailor in the Vend\u00e9e, is in ninth place, still working his way north along the coast of South America. Barring any problems like an accidental jibe that almost capsized him in 60-knot winds over the weekend, he will finish in about a month. On a gray, misty morning last week he had just rounded Cape Horn, which in theory at least meant that the rest was all downhill. ''Once you get around the cape, you usually hope for a bit of a breather,'' he said by satellite phone from his boat, Great American III. ''But it looks like there's a storm coming up, which I'm not very happy about. I'm pretty tired.'' The wind indicator at the top of his mast was not functioning properly, he explained, which meant that he could not set the autopilot properly and had to keep popping on deck to check the wind direction. The wind, which was blowing at about 35 knots, gusted through his phone and whistled halfway around the world to a cubicle in New York.","abstract":null,"print_page":"16","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/02\/03\/sports\/03sailing_75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/02\/03\/sports\/03sailing_75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/02\/03\/sports\/03sailing_600.JPG","height":331,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/02\/03\/sports\/03sailing_600.JPG","xlargeheight":331},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/02\/03\/sports\/03sailing_337.jpg","height":250,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":250,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/02\/03\/sports\/03sailing_337.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Around the World in as Long as It Takes"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"DESJOYEAUX, MICHEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"VENDEE GLOBE CHALLENGE"},{"name":"subject","value":"SAILBOATS AND SAILING"}],"pub_date":"2009-02-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Charles","lastname":"MCGRATH"}],"original":"By CHARLES MCGRATH"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26d478eb7c8105d82635d","word_count":1478},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/04\/26\/travel\/26berlinlow-high.html","snippet":"Hotels, restaurants, shopping and nightlife for every budget.","lead_paragraph":"On $250 a Day SLEEP The only thing the new Motel One (www.motel-one.de) chain has in common with an actual motel is its low price.
