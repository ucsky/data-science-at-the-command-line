''Isn't this sick?'' he said with the slightest Southern drawl. To reach him, you had to pick your way through the electrical cords and equipment of the television crew that had spread out through the house and onto the deck upstairs, filming the family for a Bravo channel reality show that will air early next year. Outside on the deck, Suzanne Vega sang a song she wrote for her daughter, Ruby Froom, 14, who also performed that night, singing the Beatles' ballad ''In My Life'' with a friend, as the camera crew -- there were three or four of them -- struggled for space in the crowd.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"New Baby, New House","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/05\/07\/garden\/2009507-novogratz-slideshow\/index.html","rank":"1","height":583,"credit":"Cortney and Robert Novogratz, a couple of serial renovators with seven children, talk about their newest home, a steel-and-concrete house on the West Side Highway.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"583","MultimediaType1":"AudioSS","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"680","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/05\/07\/garden\/2009507-novogratz-slideshow\/index.html","MultimediaSummary1":"Cortney and Robert Novogratz, a couple of serial renovators with seven children, talk about their newest home, a steel-and-concrete house on the West Side Highway.","MultimediaHeadline1":"New Baby, New House"},"type":"AudioSS","width":680},{"url":"images\/2009\/05\/07\/garden\/07novo-75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/05\/07\/garden\/07novo-75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/05\/07\/garden\/07novo-600.jpg","height":344,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/05\/07\/garden\/07novo-600.jpg","xlargeheight":344},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/05\/07\/garden\/07novo_337.jpg","height":230,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":230,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/05\/07\/garden\/07novo_337.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Branding the Family","kicker":"ON LOCATION"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"REALITY TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESTORATION AND RENOVATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOME FURNISHINGS"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOUSING AND REAL ESTATE"}],"pub_date":"2009-05-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"House & Home\/Style Desk","section_name":"Home and Garden; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Penelope","lastname":"GREEN"}],"original":"By PENELOPE GREEN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29bdb8eb7c8105d87bbeb","word_count":1826},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE0DA1639F936A35751C0A96F9C8B63","snippet":"INTERNATIONAL     BRITISH COURT BLOCKS DATA  ","lead_paragraph":"INTERNATIONAL BRITISH COURT BLOCKS DATA","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"INSIDE THE TIMES: FEBRUARY 5, 2009"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2009-02-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Summary","_id":"4fd29b788eb7c8105d87ae5c","word_count":2029},{"web_url":"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2009\/01\/28\/its-the-economy-girlfriend\/","snippet":"The economic crisis came home to 27-year-old Megan Petrus early last year when her boyfriend of eight months, a derivatives trader for a major bank, proved to be more concerned about helping a laid-off colleague than comforting Ms. Petrus after her...","lead_paragraph":"The economic crisis came home to 27-year-old Megan Petrus early last year when her boyfriend of eight months, a derivatives trader for a major bank, proved to be more concerned about helping a laid-off colleague than comforting Ms. Petrus after her father had a heart attack.","abstract":"The economic crisis came home to 27-year-old Megan Petrus early last year when her boyfriend of eight months, a derivatives trader for a major bank, proved to be more concerned about helping a laid-off colleague than comforting Ms. Petrus after her father had a heart attack.

Produced by Sarah Jessica Parker, the show, which doesn't have a title or a broadcast date, will try to do for the contemporary art world what the cable channel has done for the worlds of fine cuisine (''Top Chef'') and fashion (''Project Runway''): discover young, or maybe even middle-aged or old, unknowns with the talent to command the attention of both a television audience and a serious audience in the creative field to which they aspire.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/07\/20\/arts\/Bravo75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/07\/20\/arts\/Bravo75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/07\/20\/arts\/Bravo600.jpg","height":400,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/07\/20\/arts\/Bravo600.jpg","xlargeheight":400},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/07\/20\/arts\/20bravo.3371.jpg","height":240,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":240,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/07\/20\/arts\/20bravo.3371.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"When Art Meets TV, Realism Might Not Make It to Reality"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"BRAVO"},{"name":"subject","value":"REALITY TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2009-07-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Randy","lastname":"KENNEDY"}],"original":"By RANDY KENNEDY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29be38eb7c8105d87c3b3","word_count":986},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/11\/01\/arts\/design\/01kino.html","snippet":"A sprawling performance art festival is driven not by market forces but by a desire to amaze.","lead_paragraph":"ONE morning last month, the performance art impresario RoseLee Goldberg sat in her Chelsea office discussing a new project with the artist Wangechi Mutu.
