It's a place where anyone over 30 starts to notice that her standard fashion go-to's are suddenly has-beens and that everyone else in the environs has preternaturally dewy skin. One friend decamped from the neighborhood when she turned 32 and decided that that was too young to be the oldest person in her building -- too young, in fact, to be the oldest person anywhere, other than the prom, maybe. But the East Village, like every neighborhood in New York, has an elderly population, people who have seen more in their time than a bustling coffee shop's worth of twentysomething stylists. The older crowd is not always seen; the elderly may be too frail to get out, or when they are out, they fade into the background, mentally Photoshopped out. In Community District 3, which encompasses the East Village, the Lower East Side and Chinatown, 31 percent of people who are 65 or older are living at or below poverty level, the second-highest rate for the elderly in New York City, according to the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. And poverty tends to render their ranks even less visible.","abstract":"Susan Dominus Big City column discusses how elderly population of East Village is rarely seen; highlights Educational Alliance's Sirovich Senior Center, where elderly celebrate Halloween with costume party; photo (M)","print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/10\/31\/nyregion\/31bigcity01\/thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/10\/31\/nyregion\/31bigcity01\/thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/10\/31\/nyregion\/31bigcity01\/articleLarge.jpg","height":360,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/10\/31\/nyregion\/31bigcity01\/articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":360},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Where 30 Is Ancient, Youthful at 80","kicker":"BIG CITY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"EAST VILLAGE (NYC)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LOWER EAST SIDE (NYC)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MANHATTAN (NYC)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EDUCATIONAL ALLIANCE SIROVICH SENIOR CENTER"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EDUCATIONAL ALLIANCE"},{"name":"subject","value":"COSTUMES"},{"name":"subject","value":"HALLOWEEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELDERLY"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARTIES (SOCIAL)"}],"pub_date":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Susan","lastname":"DOMINUS"}],"original":"By SUSAN DOMINUS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd274b48eb7c8105d833c76","word_count":762},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9E00EFDD1738F931A15751C0A96F9C8B63","snippet":"Gray, a favorite of elegant Edwardians in 1910, and the foundation color of Dior's 1947 romantic New Look, made a surprise appearance on  guests and a dandy French bulldog last week at New York Fashion Week.
