The remarks, in response to questions from reporters in the Oval Office, amounted to a shift for the White House. The president had repeatedly said that the nation should look forward rather than focusing on the past, and his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said Sunday in a television interview that Mr. Obama believed that ''those who devised policy'' should not be prosecuted.","abstract":null,"print_page":"17","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Justice Department Memos","url":"http:\/\/documents.nytimes.com\/justice-department-memos-on-interrogation-techniques#p=1","rank":"1","height":700,"credit":"Files from 2002 and 2005 released by the Justice Department detailing interrogation techniques used by C.I.A. operatives.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"700","MultimediaType1":"External","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"820","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/documents.nytimes.com\/justice-department-memos-on-interrogation-techniques#p=1","MultimediaSummary1":"Files from 2002 and 2005 released by the Justice Department detailing interrogation techniques used by C.I.A. operatives.","MultimediaHeadline1":"Justice Department Memos"},"type":"External","width":820},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/04\/22\/us\/22intel_600.JPG","height":331,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/04\/22\/us\/22intel_600.JPG","xlargeheight":331},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Obama Won't Bar Inquiry, or Penalty, on Interrogations"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"OBAMA, BARACK"},{"name":"organizations","value":"JUSTICE DEPARTMENT"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY"},{"name":"subject","value":"DETAINEES"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TORTURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERROGATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2009-04-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Sheryl","middlename":"Gay","lastname":"STOLBERG","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Peter Baker contributed reporting"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26d4f8eb7c8105d826bfe","word_count":1113},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/04\/19\/nyregion\/thecity\/19norv.html","snippet":"A major figure in the city\u2019s architectural circles, along with a new and younger partner, has taken to the streets to remake the city\u2019s most legendary guidebook.","lead_paragraph":"NORVAL WHITE, one of the great figures of New York architecture, was cruising around Long Island City a couple of months ago when he came upon an unexpected sight.

Its designer, Robert Scarano Jr., is one of the less beloved figures among the city's architectural cognoscenti, and much to Mr. White's amazement, he didn't actually hate the thing. ''It's definitely a cut above his other stuff,'' Mr. White, his lean, 6-foot-5 frame tucked into the front seat of a gray Subaru Forester, acknowledged in his plummy baritone. ''It has some quality.

Ten years after Columbine, it only now may be sinking in that the psychopathic killers were not jock-hating dorks from a ''Trench Coat Mafia,'' or, as ABC News maintained at the time, ''part of a dark, underground national phenomenon known as the Gothic movement.'' In the new best seller ''Columbine,'' the journalist Dave Cullen reaffirms that Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were instead ordinary American teenagers who worked at the local pizza joint, loved their parents and were popular among their classmates. On Tuesday, it will be five years since Americans first confronted the photographs from Abu Ghraib on ''60 Minutes II.'' Here, too, we want to cling to myths that quarantine the evil. If our country committed torture, surely it did so to prevent Armageddon, in a patriotic ticking-time-bomb scenario out of ''24.'' If anyone deserves blame, it was only those identified by President Bush as ''a few American troops who dishonored our country and disregarded our values'': promiscuous, sinister-looking lowlifes like Lynddie England, Charles Graner and the other grunts who were held accountable while the top command got a pass.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/04\/26\/opinion\/26blitt75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/04\/26\/opinion\/26blitt75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/04\/26\/opinion\/26blitt.jpg","height":1189,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/04\/26\/opinion\/26blitt.jpg","xlargeheight":1189},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"The Banality of Bush White House Evil","kicker":"OP-ED COLUMNIST"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BYBEE, JAY S"},{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"persons","value":"ZUBAYDAH, ABU"},{"name":"organizations","value":"JUSTICE DEPARTMENT"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY"},{"name":"subject","value":"IRAQ WAR (2003- )"},{"name":"subject","value":"TORTURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERROGATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2009-04-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Frank","lastname":"RICH"}],"original":"By FRANK RICH"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd28ced8eb7c8105d8621b6","word_count":1652},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/06\/arts\/06wspare.html","snippet":"Information about events to be considered for inclusion in Spare Times can be sent to weekend@nytimes.com.","lead_paragraph":"Information about events to be considered for inclusion in Spare Times can be sent to weekend@nytimes.com.
