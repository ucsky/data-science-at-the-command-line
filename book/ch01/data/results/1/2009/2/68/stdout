Today was Tarantino day, with much anxiety and anticipation in the air, as much for the premiere of \"Inglourious Basterds\" as for the arrival of Brad and Angelina, who were scheduled to walk up the stairs of the Palais at 6:50 p.m. local time. The action has really picked up these last 12 hours; the halls of the Martinez are now closed to the public and guests are required to carry a special I.D. in order to get through all of the newly installed security checkpoints.Without a movie commitment for the afternoon, I take a deep breath and dive not into the hotel pool but rather into underworld of the festival. By underworld I don't mean the business of buying and selling and distributing films, or even the hangers-on who keep the various V.I.P.'s stocked with call-girls, rent-boys or other addictive substances of choice. No, here I'm talking about the fashion product placement industry -- the business of putting gowns, tuxedos, earrings and necklaces on the backs, ears and necks of celebrities, not to mention the screens of your television and the pages of your newspapers and magazines.","abstract":"Cannes is catching up with me and to be honest I am not so sure how much longer I will last before surrendering to the call of the beach.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Cannes Heat | Day 3 on the Cote d'Azur","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-05-21T17:10:46Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stefano","rank":1,"lastname":"TONCHI"}],"original":"By STEFANO TONCHI"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd395398eb7c8105d8cad1a","word_count":1467},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/06\/28\/fashion\/28love.html","snippet":"A father makes bumbling attempts at motherly things.","lead_paragraph":"A father makes bumbling attempts at motherly things.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":75,"url":"images\/2009\/06\/26\/style\/28love_75.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2009\/06\/26\/style\/28love_75.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Raising a Princess Single-Handedly","content_kicker":"Modern Love","kicker":"Modern Love","print_headline":"Raising a Princess Single-Handedly"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Love (Emotion)"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Parenting"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Children and Youth"}],"pub_date":"2009-06-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Styles","section_name":"Fashion & Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Simon","middlename":"Van","lastname":"BOOY","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By SIMON VAN BOOY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"53e148b3798810409a1b686a","word_count":"1681"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/07\/02\/fashion\/02monkey.html","snippet":"At the Monkey Bar in Manhattan, the restaurant seating chart is the map to the famous and connected.","lead_paragraph":"ON the first night Graydon Carter ever ate in a New York restaurant, he mistook one well-known person for another.
