The first two, one could argue, represent a return to optimism by those designers who are holding out hope that stocks really do rise with hemlines. The third is bit of a mystery. Or, as Linda Wells, the editor of Allure, put it last week in a video interview, ''perfectly insane.''

Mazo wrote in 1974); he appeared on television and in Life magazine, his muscles rippling like the boxer he had been in college. Despite Balanchine's famed preference for his female dancers, he created some of his greatest choreography for Mr. Villella, who in 1984 founded the Miami City Ballet, now considered one of the most important troupes in the country, largely by virtue of its incisive performances of the Balanchine repertory.
