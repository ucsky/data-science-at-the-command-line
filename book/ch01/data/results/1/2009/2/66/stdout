(Or perhaps the turkey.) But the vegetables, mashed potatoes and desserts -- that is, watching TV online or on mobile devices, and discussing TV shows with friends in social media like Facebook and Twitter -- are becoming bigger parts of the meal. That new approach to how people consume TV -- and how advertisers buy commercial time on programs -- has been a major subject of discussion during the upfront week in New York. The event derives its name from the efforts by TV executives to sell commercials before the start of the new season.","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/05\/21\/business\/21adco01-75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/05\/21\/business\/21adco01-75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/05\/21\/business\/21adco01-650.jpg","height":450,"width":650,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":650,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/05\/21\/business\/21adco01-650.jpg","xlargeheight":450},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"CW Adds Shows To Text About","kicker":"ADVERTISING"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"ADVERTISING AND MARKETING"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}],"pub_date":"2009-05-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Technology; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Stuart","lastname":"ELLIOTT"}],"original":"By STUART ELLIOTT; Brian Stelter and Edward Wyatt contributed reporting"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26f648eb7c8105d829f2d","word_count":1152},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B02E2D91638F933A2575BC0A96F9C8B63","snippet":"8 P.M.
