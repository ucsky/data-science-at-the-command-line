Madame Figaro, like all such magazines, has been somewhat crisis-starved of ads and thus pagination of late, but fashion week -- and fashion houses determined that the shows will go on -- bulked it up again. Nonetheless, fashionistas could not miss the main point: times are tough, or at least much tougher, as evidenced in the 10 detailed tips for ''recessionistas'' about maintaining cool and chic even on diminished budgets (mostly this seems to involve trawling Web sites that will offer you slightly used couture on the cheap).","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"International Herald Tribune","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"On Living With Less, From 3 Points of View","kicker":"LETTER FROM EUROPE"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2009-03-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Alison","lastname":"SMALE"}],"original":"By ALISON SMALE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26efe8eb7c8105d829a06","word_count":1018},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9A00EFDC163FF937A2575AC0A96F9C8B63","snippet":"7 P.M.

There is madras everything, button-downs everywhere. Nantucket reds -- washed-out pink pants -- are the new khakis; Sperry Top-Siders are more common on roof decks than top decks; and the Polo pony and the Lacoste crocodile are now but two of the critters in a zoo of polo shirt insignia. Lately the trend has taken on a new dimension, via the Internet, with a resurgence of interest in once obscure American brands. Alongside the familiar L. L. Bean duck boots, Brooks Brothers shirts and Ray-Ban Wayfarers, there are Filson duffel bags, Gokey boots, Alden dress shoes, Gitman oxford shirts, Quoddy Trail moccasins, Wm. J. Mills canvas totes -- to name but a few. Moribund brands like Southwick and Woolrich are being revived with new designs. And the old-school look has been furthered by popular American fashion labels -- small houses like Thom Browne, Band of Outsiders and Benjamin Bixby along with megabrands like J.
