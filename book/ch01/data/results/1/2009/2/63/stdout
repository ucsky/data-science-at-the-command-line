De la Renta likes to go to Punta Cana as soon as work in his Seventh Avenue office allows, typically in mid-December, and he returns to the island for an even longer stay after the February shows, joined by more friends. Aside from the tropical heat and the blue-green water, it's easy to see why people like to stay with the de la Rentas. The many-columned, coral-stone house looks like Hollywood's dream of a colonial plantation. It was actually designed by a Cuban-born architect, Ernesto Buch, who was recommended by the writer John Richardson, another regular guest. De la Renta is renowned for his perfectionism -- ''He notices everything,'' said John Fairchild, the retired publisher of Women's Wear Daily -- and perhaps for that reason he was annoyed when I told him I would be bunking down the road at a hotel during my stay. ''That's a pain in the ass,'' he said crossly. He seemed uninterested in my ''conflict of interest'' argument. I assured him the hotel would be fine. Then, changing his tone, he said: ''I'll meet you at the bottom of the plane's stairs. Bring your monokini!'' The remark was typical of him, and considering that our exchange took place the day after he and his wife had dined at the Kissingers', in early December, with Timothy Geithner, Lawrence H. Summers, Robert Rubin and Mayor Bloomberg, it suggested the range and quality of his chitchat -- from bailouts all the way to monokinis. But never mind. I was more intrigued that Don Oscar could meet a commercial airliner at wingtip at a busy international airport. Granted, next to a string of baseball players, he is his country's most famous personality, but I wondered how even he could pull off such a security breach. Well, evidently he can. He is a chairman of the private development group that owns much of Punta Cana, some 15,000 acres, including the airport and the water system. It also owns, among other resort properties, the hotel where I'd be staying. Ralph Lauren may have his line of steaks, Valentino a gazillion houses, but de la Renta has his mini-state.","abstract":null,"print_page":"176","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Oscar's...Wild!"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"DE LA RENTA, OSCAR"},{"name":"subject","value":"DESIGN"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-02-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Women's Fashion Magazine","section_name":"Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26d488eb7c8105d8264e4","word_count":2787},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/04\/26\/fashion\/26bustelo.html","snippet":"Caf\u00e9 Bustelo, the old Cuban-style espresso, is trying to win South Beach and keep the Bronx.","lead_paragraph":"OUTSIDE a small ranch house in the Southern California desert on April 19, one of the satellite parties of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was reaching its midafternoon peak.

On her highly rated Oxygen reality series, ''Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood'' and in her books, ''sTORI Telling'' and ''Mommywood'' -- currently No. 21 on the New York Times best-seller list -- she presents herself as an American everywoman trying to juggle it all: motherhood, a line of jewelry for the Home Shopping Network, designing baby clothes and posing for shoots in People magazine while also complaining about the intrusions of Los Angeles paparazzi. Ms. Spelling works her Ugg boots off, and she is not self-effacing about it, cultivating privacy the way that Donald Trump seeks an image of humility. ''Tori & Dean'' (which begins anew on Tuesday) is itself an exercise in controversion, as Ms. Spelling's attempts to avoid photographers with long lenses are in turn filmed by the camera crew she has invited to follow her around while she navigates life with her husband, Dean McDermott, and their children Liam and Stella Doreen. An added strangeness lies in the couple's incessant conversation about spreading themselves too thin, when they could add so many more happy hours to their week simply by refusing to appear in a reality show about their inclination to overextend themselves.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/05\/26\/arts\/Tori75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/05\/26\/arts\/Tori75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/05\/26\/arts\/Tori600.jpg","height":344,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/05\/26\/arts\/Tori600.jpg","xlargeheight":344},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Examined Lives: So Many Camera Crews, So Little Time","kicker":"TELEVISION REVIEW | 'TORI & DEAN'"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"LITTLE COUPLE, THE (TV PROGRAM)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE (TV PROGRAM)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"TORI & DEAN (TV PROGRAM)"},{"name":"persons","value":"SPELLING, TORI"},{"name":"persons","value":"MCDERMOTT, DEAN"},{"name":"persons","value":"DOONAN, SIMON"},{"name":"organizations","value":"LOGO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"OXYGEN MEDIA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TLC"},{"name":"subject","value":"REALITY TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"}],"pub_date":"2009-05-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ginia","lastname":"BELLAFANTE"}],"original":"By GINIA BELLAFANTE"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd29bdc8eb7c8105d87bcbc","word_count":890},{"web_url":"http:\/\/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/03\/23\/state-senator-indicted-in-stabbing\/","snippet":"Hiram Monserrate of Queens faces a felony assault indictment on a charge that he stabbed his girlfriend last December with a drinking glass, prosecutors said.","lead_paragraph":"Updated, 4:45 p.m. | A Queens grand jury on Monday handed up a felony assault indictment against State Senator Hiram Monserrate, charging that he stabbed his girlfriend last December with a drinking glass, leaving a gash that required 20 stitches to close, prosecutors announced.","abstract":"Hiram Monserrate of Queens faces a felony assault indictment on a charge that he stabbed his girlfriend last December with a drinking glass, prosecutors said.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"State Senator Is Indicted in Stabbing","kicker":"City Room"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-03-23T12:46:12Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"N.Y. \/ Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"William","middlename":"K.","lastname":"RASHBAUM","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By WILLIAM K.
