It was about the ways that social media -- blogging, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and the like -- have, almost overnight, become an integral part of how fashion brands get their message to the public. The shows during September and October were a first glimpse of what the elitist fashion world could soon become: a business where designers take their collections directly to customers, no longer filtered through fashion editors at glossy magazines and buyers at top stores.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"International Herald Tribune","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"From Couture -- to Conversation","kicker":"SPECIAL REPORT"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-11-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jessica","lastname":"MICHAULT"}],"original":"By JESSICA MICHAULT"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd276b08eb7c8105d837aba","word_count":1036},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE6DA1230F933A1575AC0A96F9C8B63","snippet":"A signature look has emerged: draped dresses worn with shoes that make a statement, often with killer heels.

The combination is what many of the most stylish guests chose to wear last week to the New York designer collections. After the shows, women were frequently seen changing to flip-flops. But no one is going to give up those heels. The 1940s draping is breathing new life into the one-piece dress. It also sometimes appears only on a skirt or a neckline. Care should be taken with draping, however; it can look matronly. As for handbags, they have been completely eclipsed by the shoe. One of the big surprises at the showings was the presentation of Tory Burch, who had championed flats, but this time showed her models in high heels (inset).","abstract":"Women don draped dresses and statement boots and shoes for fashion week; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Look","kicker":"ON THE STREET"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOES AND BOOTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"DRESSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-09-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"CUNNINGHAM"}],"original":"By BILL CUNNINGHAM"},"type_of_material":"Caption","_id":"4fd28b338eb7c8105d85ed57","word_count":134},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/06\/20\/fashion\/20iht-rwomen.html","snippet":"Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez led the women\u2019s fashion showing at the spring 2010 Pitti event.","lead_paragraph":"Correction Appended FLORENCE -- ''It's been quite a week,'' chorused Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez as they surveyed the grand Florentine palazzo surroundings and thought back to Monday, when they were in New York to receive an award as accessories designers of the year from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"International Herald Tribune","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/06\/19\/fashion\/75forrwomen.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/06\/19\/fashion\/75forrwomen.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Proenza Schouler Injects a Bit of Cool","kicker":"SPECIAL REPORT: MEN'S FASHION"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SCHOULER, PROENZA"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-06-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Suzy","lastname":"MENKES"}],"original":"By SUZY MENKES"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28ec18eb7c8105d86596b","word_count":502},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/09\/17\/fashion\/17iht-rcrafts.html","snippet":"Dense handwork, lively patterns and drapes of mixed fabrics are all giving a fresh spin to the 2010 summer season.","lead_paragraph":"NEW YORK -- Looking across the angular architecture of the Museum of Modern Art to a display of the designer Ron Arad's sculptured silver chairs, the scene looked like the essence of American style: a streamlined modernism without fuss or embellishment.

I feel sort of the same about the arrival of spring and forsythia. It's been a hard spring, though, for many people. Eventually you know someone who has lost his or her job. A small part of me bristles when I see an article declaring \"the end of excess,\" because I know that lots of intelligent people already do live modestly by choice if not necessity. So who is the lecture for? Over the next year or two, the fashion industry will be significantly altered, as will coverage of the industry in glossy magazines and newspapers, which are experiencing their own traumas. If people are being more careful about what they buy, it seems to me they will also be picky about what they choose to read. What things will matter to people without trivializing the seriousness of the economy or, at the same time, being a complete downer browner and forgetting that fashion is a source of pleasure? It's also a livelihood for millions of people.","abstract":"Bryan Bedder\/Getty Images The designer Georgina Chapman attends the celebration of the launch of Topshop in New York.
