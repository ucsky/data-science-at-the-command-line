The program opens with ''Expo,'' an overture written for the occasion by Magnus Lindberg, the Philharmonic's composer in residence, and includes Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fantastique'' and Messiaen's ''Po\u00e8mes Pour Mi,'' performed by the soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming. Alec Baldwin, the new voice of ''The New York Philharmonic This Week,'' the orchestra's weekly national radio broadcast, is host. In ''Vienna Philharmonic Summer Night's Concert 2009,'' presented at 10 by ''Great Performances,'' Daniel Barenboim conducts the orchestra on the grounds of the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace. The night-theme program features ''A Little Night Music'' by Mozart, ''A Thousand and One Nights'' by Johann Strauss and ''A Night on Bald Mountain'' by Mussorgsky. Mr. Barenboim does double duty as the pianist in de Falla's ''Nights in the Gardens of Spain.'' 7 A.M.
