Rose CorderoWith an inscrutable stare and a Grace Jones flat top, the Dominican Rose Cordero was one of the most buzzed-about newcomers before New York fashion week. Her menacing stomp recalls May Day, Jones's character in \"A View to a Kill,\" and her shoulders bounce seamlessly to the soundtrack. It looked best at Vuitton, where she took to the runway in a belted red wrap coat, livening the bulky shape with ease. And unlike many of her contemporaries, Cordero has never been interviewed, adding to her mystique.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Walk-Off | Four New Catwalk Stars","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-03-18T12:14:42Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"T.","middlename":"J.","lastname":"SWEENEY","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By T.J.
