There are the street aesthetes like Alexander Wang, whose game is to manipulate classics. But others see grids and transparent openings, as if trying to match the form of a new skyscraper. Designers like Alexa Adams and Flora Gill of the label Ohne Titel may be limited to silk, leather and knitted wool, yet their modernist collages suggested they weren't constrained and that they wanted to create a feeling of suspension and void. They did this very well, with multicolor knit dresses, textured leggings and leather sandals that seemed to have tension wires for lacing. The curving lines continued in the tailoring and in evening dresses with overlapping pieces and hems barnacled with silk knots and feathers. At the moment, round, rather than sharp-cut, looks right -- perhaps because it follows the body.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn reviews New York runway shows of Alexander Wang, Altuzarra, Derek Lam, Ohne Titel, Preen and Richard Chai; photos","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Backstage Scenes","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2009\/09\/11\/fashion\/091109-BACKSTAGE_FW_index.html","rank":"1","height":700,"credit":"A backstage view of the Jason Wu, Loden Dager and Preen shows.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"700","MultimediaType1":"Slideshow","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"750","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2009\/09\/11\/fashion\/091109-BACKSTAGE_FW_index.html","MultimediaSummary1":"A backstage view of the Jason Wu, Loden Dager and Preen shows.","MultimediaHeadline1":"Backstage Scenes"},"type":"Slideshow","width":750},{"url":"images\/2009\/09\/14\/fashion\/weddings\/14review.751.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/09\/14\/fashion\/weddings\/14review.751.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/09\/14\/fashion\/weddings\/14review.3371.jpg","height":250,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":250,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/09\/14\/fashion\/weddings\/14review.3371.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"A Varied Skyline Enlivens the View","kicker":"FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"WESTWOOD, VIVIENNE"},{"name":"persons","value":"PREEN"},{"name":"persons","value":"CHAI, RICHARD"},{"name":"persons","value":"ALTUZARRA, JOSEPH"},{"name":"persons","value":"WANG, ALEXANDER"},{"name":"persons","value":"KAWAKUBO, REI"},{"name":"persons","value":"LAM, DEREK"},{"name":"organizations","value":"OHNE TITEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRADE SHOWS AND FAIRS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-09-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Fashion","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd274b08eb7c8105d8339eb","word_count":617},{"web_url":"http:\/\/slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/09\/10\/its-fashion-week\/","snippet":"Sean Avery and Fashion Week -- a match made in heaven.","lead_paragraph":"Fashion Week begins in New York on Thursday, giving Sean Avery a couple of days for his real passion before he starts Rangers training camp in the northern suburbs.

This Week Only Paul Rowland, \"Transformations\" (Feb. 12 to Feb. 20)Nothing says New York Fashion Week like a photo exhibition by an owner of a modeling agency.

Manzoni's experimentations with fabric squares and (what looked like) stuffing material are the most arresting use of textiles you'll see all week.\"Stop, Repair, Prepare\" at Gladstone galleryThis performance art piece by Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla is too insane to miss.
