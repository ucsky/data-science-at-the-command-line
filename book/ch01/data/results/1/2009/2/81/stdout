Paulson Jr. agreed to hold himself to a higher ethical standard than his predecessors. He not only sold all his holdings in Goldman Sachs, the investment bank he had run, but also specifically said that he would avoid any substantive interaction with Goldman executives for his entire term unless he first obtained an ethics waiver from the government. But today, seven months after Mr. Paulson left office, questions are still being asked about his part in decisions last fall to prop up the teetering financial system with tens of billions of taxpayer dollars, including aid that directly benefited his former firm. Testifying on Capitol Hill last month, he was grilled about his relationship with Goldman.","abstract":"Former Treasury Sec Henry M Paulson Jr's role in decisions last fall to prop up teetering financial system remains controversial seven months after he left office; Paulson insists he acted within ethical guidelines and sought waivers for his interactions with Goldman Sachs, his former firm; those waivers are dated day after American International Group received $55 billion in federal money to pay off Goldman and other banks; Paulson spoke to Goldman chief executive Lloyd C Blankfein far more often during week of AIG bailout than he did with other Wall Street executives; photos (L)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/08\/09\/business\/09paulson_75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/08\/09\/business\/09paulson_75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/08\/09\/business\/09paulson_600.jpg","height":366,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/08\/09\/business\/09paulson_600.jpg","xlargeheight":366},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/08\/09\/business\/09paulson_337.jpg","height":240,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":240,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/08\/09\/business\/09paulson_337.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Paulson's Calls to Goldman Tested Ethics During Crisis"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"PAULSON, HENRY M JR"},{"name":"persons","value":"BLANKFEIN, LLOYD C"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TREASURY DEPARTMENT"},{"name":"organizations","value":"AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP"},{"name":"subject","value":"INSURANCE"},{"name":"subject","value":"EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT (2008)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"STOCKS AND BONDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"},{"name":"subject","value":"REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKS AND BANKING"}],"pub_date":"2009-08-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Front Page; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Gretchen","lastname":"MORGENSON"},{"qualifier":"Jr","firstname":"Don","middlename":"Van","lastname":"NATTA","rank":2,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and DON VAN NATTA Jr"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28ebf8eb7c8105d8657e3","word_count":2661},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/02\/arts\/02koni.html","snippet":"On the road again, Tom Arnold knows his life is the stuff of comedy.","lead_paragraph":"TOM ARNOLD was in town a couple of weekends ago to headline at Carolines on Broadway, a return after 16 years to stand-up comedy, the m\u00e9tier that set him on an up-and-down trajectory that has included, in no particular order, four weddings (the first two to Roseanne Barr), with a fifth on the way; a staggering number of appearances on late-night talk shows; and acting roles in ''65 movies, three good ones,'' as he put it.

At 10:30 a.m., amid gray but not ominous skies, the S.V. Illusion -- the 75-foot, two-masted schooner on which I and two others were novice sailors -- had weighed anchor off the coast of Vieux Fort, a sleepy city at the island's southern tip, and steered into deeper waters. The sea was mild, with five-foot swells rocking us just enough to make walking a conscious effort, and when Norman Garnett, the Illusion's 61-year-old English captain, gave the order, we scrambled to pull, feed, winch and cleat a series of ropes that unfurled our three sails, which caught and tightened in the wind. We were sailing! At first, we cruised along without a care. The sun revealed itself, we applied SPF 30 and we fetched paperback novels to read on deck. A pod of pilot whales surfaced off the port bow, then vanished, heading west. This was, it seemed, a cinch, a few minutes of complicated labor in exchange for untold hours of relaxation. But midway, we began to notice something odd. We were tilting to starboard. Severely. The thickening swells, in fact, were almost touching the worn wooden rail that arced around the ship. Was this normal? The wind was picking up, droplets of rain coming down.
