I wandered around for several minutes, and then stopped at a brown, low-slung, three-seater sofa near the front of the showroom. A saleswoman was soon by my side. The sofa was made in the Netherlands, I was told. The designer, Bjorn Mulder, is a big shot in Europe, I was told.

War was raging in Helmand and Kandahar. And yet there was an atmosphere of burlesque about the place. Waiters hammed up their service, skidding across the floor balancing mounds of rice, bananas and chicken, whirling shopping carts of Coke and Fanta. The organizer of the event and master of ceremonies was none other than Sher Muhammad Akhundzada, the five-foot-tall ex-governor of Helmand and probably the country's most infamous drug trafficker. From a velvet couch he barked out to the speakers: ''Not so many poems! Keep your speeches short!'' -- but no one was listening. At my table, an elderly Helmandi engineer described how awful things were in his region -- families killed in coalition airstrikes, villages overrun by the Taliban. So why more Karzai? ''If we choose someone else, it will only get worse,'' he said through an interpreter. Another man said that at least Karzai had brought education and unity. ''They are all lying,'' a third said in English. He was the son of a prominent Kandahari elder who, a year before, was assassinated outside the family's house. He'd also lost his uncle, brother and 45 other members of his extended family, he told me. He blamed the government. He was shaking his head at the spectacle in the wedding hall. ''I told the men at my table, 'You just came to show your faces on camera so if Karzai wins he will give you privileges.' '' He laughed and said, ''They told me they just came for lunch.'' I asked what he thought would happen during the election in Kandahar. ''Fraud,'' he said. He himself claimed to have made 8,000 fake voter-registration cards. They were selling for $20.","abstract":"Elizabeth Rubin article examines Pres Hamid Karzai's re-election efforts in run-up to Aug 20 balloting; Karzai and his government are routinely criticized as corrupt; he appears to see himself as protector and father of Afghan nation, but it is often difficult to ascertain what his true beliefs are; friends describe him as stressed and easy to snap, but say he wants to redeem his legacy; photos (L)","print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/08\/04\/magazine\/09karzai-500.jpg","height":500,"width":401,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":401,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/08\/04\/magazine\/09karzai-500.jpg","xlargeheight":500},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Karzai In His Labyrinth"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KARZAI, HAMID"},{"name":"persons","value":"FAHIM, MUHAMMAD"},{"name":"persons","value":"GHANI, ASHRAF"},{"name":"persons","value":"ABDULLAH, ABDULLAH"},{"name":"glocations","value":"AFGHANISTAN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TALIBAN"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"AFGHANISTAN WAR (2001- )"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TERRORISM"}],"pub_date":"2009-08-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Elizabeth","lastname":"RUBIN"}],"original":"By ELIZABETH RUBIN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2743c8eb7c8105d832462","word_count":9734},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/02\/us\/02suicide.html","snippet":"The rising toll of suicides in the military has hit a National Guard unit particularly hard: four soldiers, out of roughly 175 members, have committed suicide.","lead_paragraph":"Sgt.

TNT brings back four dramas and adds two more, one starring Jada Pinkett Smith and one backed by Jerry Bruckheimer.

Secessionists. Angry neighbors. Smoldering generals. And Asif Ali Zardari, with the job of keeping his country from becoming the most dangerous failed state in the world.","lead_paragraph":"TO ENTER the office where Asif Ali Zardari, the president of Pakistan, conducts his business, you head down a long corridor toward two wax statues of exceptionally tall soldiers, each in a long, white tunic with a glittering column of buttons. On closer inspection, these turn out to be actual humans who have been trained in the arts of immobility. The office they guard, though large, is not especially opulent or stupefying by the standards of such places. President Zardari met me just inside the doorway, then seated himself facing a widescreen TV displaying an image of fish swimming in a deep blue sea. His party spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, and his presidential spokesman, Farahnaz Ispahani, sat facing him, almost as rigid as the soldiers. Zardari is famous for straying off message and saying odd things or jumbling facts and figures. He is also famous for blaming his aides when things go wrong -- and things have been going wrong quite a lot lately. Zardari's aides didn't want him to talk to me. Now they were tensely waiting for a mishap. The president himself, natty in a navy suit, his black hair brilliantined to a sheen, was the very picture of ease. Zardari beamed when we talked about New York, where he often lived between 2004, when he was released from prison after eight years, and late 2007, when he returned to Pakistan not long after his wife, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated by terrorists. For all that painful recent history, Zardari is a suave and charming man with a sly grin, and he gives the impression of thoroughly enjoying what must be among the world's least desirable jobs. Zardari had just been through the most dangerous weeks of his six months in office. He dissolved the government in Punjab, Pakistan's dominant state, and called out the police to stop the country's lawyers and leading opposition party from holding a ''long march'' to demand the reinstatement of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who had been sacked, along with most of the high judiciary, by Zardari's predecessor, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. Zardari defused the situation only by allowing Chaudhry's return to office and giving in to other demands that he had previously and repeatedly rejected.","abstract":null,"print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/04\/05\/magazine\/05zardari-75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/04\/05\/magazine\/05zardari-75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/04\/05\/magazine\/05zardari-600.jpg","height":371,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/04\/05\/magazine\/05zardari-600.jpg","xlargeheight":371},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/04\/05\/magazine\/05zardari-337.jpg","height":250,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":250,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/04\/05\/magazine\/05zardari-337.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Can Pakistan Be Governed?"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SHARIF, NAWAZ"},{"name":"persons","value":"ZARDARI, ASIF ALI"},{"name":"persons","value":"BHUTTO, BENAZIR"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PAKISTAN"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}],"pub_date":"2009-04-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"James","lastname":"TRAUB"}],"original":"By JAMES TRAUB"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26d4f8eb7c8105d826bda","word_count":7592}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
