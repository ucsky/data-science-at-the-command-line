Evidently it is a native quality, which Osmo Vanska, the feisty Finnish conductor who has been the orchestra's music director since 2003, has only reinforced. Undaunted by New York's proprietary claim on Leonard Bernstein or by its recent three-month citywide festival celebrating his 90th birthday, Mr. Vanska and the orchestra have embarked on a two-week Bernstein festival of their own at Orchestra Hall here. Mr. Vanska might seem an unlikely champion of this most American of composers, but he cites Bernstein as a formative influence, through his Young People's Concerts, televised even in Finland; his recordings (one of the first LPs Mr. Vanska heard as a child was a Bernstein account of Brahms's Second Symphony); and his performances at the Helsinki Festival. ''I like his way of taking risks and living big, and giving whatever he did his all,'' Mr. Vanska has said.","abstract":null,"print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/01\/19\/arts\/Bernstein1650.jpg","height":416,"width":650,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":650,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/01\/19\/arts\/Bernstein1650.jpg","xlargeheight":416},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Bernstein Festival Far From the Hudson","kicker":"MUSIC REVIEW | MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VANSKA, OSMO"},{"name":"persons","value":"BERNSTEIN, LEONARD"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MINNEAPOLIS (MINN)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA"},{"name":"subject","value":"CLASSICAL MUSIC"}],"pub_date":"2009-01-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"James","middlename":"R.","lastname":"OESTREICH","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By JAMES R.
