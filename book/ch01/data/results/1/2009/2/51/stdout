Josie and I were waiting for her older brother to come along and drive us back to Sconset. We were 13. The Bonnie station wagon was parked in front of the Bosun's Locker, a mysterious place to me then, the last bar on Main Street, and a young woman announced (with some hysteria, I thought at the time) that she and her boyfriend were going to get married. Then and there. The woman kept flitting in and out of the bar, looking, I guess, for her groom. It all seemed perfectly normal, even to a 13-year-old, but for some reason I have chosen, as E.B. White would say, to put it away in lavender. Somewhere in a shoebox at home there is a picture of me on Alter Rock, in a cut-off jean skirt and faded blue flannel shirt. That is my chief sartorial memory of that period, but what else would be contained in a memory from then?","abstract":"I was sitting with Josie Bonnie on the hood of the Bonnie family clunker on Main Street in Nantucket.

You either get it or you don't -- and Mabille catches the elusive perfume of haute couture\" (The International Herald Tribune) \"Alexis Mabille is a newcomer to the couture scene, at least with his own label. The clothes seesawed from awkward .\u2009.\u2009. to sophisticated. .\u2009.\u2009. But Mr. Mabille has the couture juice\" (The New York Times) \"Now that Michelle Obama has come out so solidly in support of young American designers, it's only natural to wonder whether Paris has an on-the-rise talent of its own who could be taken up by France's first lady. One such contender might be Alexis Mabille\" (style.com) \"Alexis Mabille is one of fashion's brightest young lights\" (WWD) Anne Val\u00e9rie Hash | designer: Anne Val\u00e9rie Hash | slide show \"Anne Val\u00e9rie Hash isn't about to let the recession deflect her from pursuing made-to-measure clothes, but she's being pragmatic about it: 'I didn't do a show this season; instead I decided to really focus on what people really ask us for -- and that's wedding dresses and smokings.' Smart move\" (style.com) \"calm and collected\" (WWD) Armani Priv\u00e9 | designer: Giorgio Armani | slide show \"The elegant silence of well-judged tailoring and of running water colors was replaced by some wild forays into Chinese emperor drapes and lacquer-hard colors like purple, yellow and red. .\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.

He was like a fly that landed on a leaf and surveyed all. But the leaf told him everything\" (The New York Times) \"An all-white collection sounds like an exercise in clinical minimalism, but it wasn't.

Artists do this all the time without the intent -- giving themselves over to excess, retreating to ashrams -- but Ms. Bassman's approach was aggressive and determined. Disillusioned by the costuming of the late 1960s, she had had enough of fashion and expressed her disdain by destroying decades' worth of negatives and placing others in a trash bag in the coal room of her Upper East Side carriage house. Her era of furtive eroticism was over, and there was no point in scrapbooking it. Years later Ms. Bassman, who is 92, relented and retrieved her discarded images, seeking creative ways to reprint them. Some of these pictures will be on view at a new show at KMR Arts in Washington Depot, Conn. (which begins Saturday and runs through Sept. 5), juxtaposed with an anatomically resonant series on sidewalk cracks that she produced in the '70s. The exhibition serves as a preamble to a moment of renewed interest in Ms. Bassman's career; this fall Abrams will publish a book of her work, ''Lillian Bassman: Women,'' which will accompany a show at the Staley-Wise Gallery. And in November the Deichtorhallen museum in Hamburg, Germany, will mount a retrospective of her photography, along with that of her husband, Paul Himmel, who died in February.","abstract":null,"print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/07\/17\/arts\/17bass_75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/07\/17\/arts\/17bass_75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/07\/17\/arts\/17bass_500.jpg","height":500,"width":498,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":498,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/07\/17\/arts\/17bass_500.jpg","xlargeheight":500},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/07\/17\/arts\/17bassman_337.jpg","height":337,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":337,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/07\/17\/arts\/17bassman_337.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Femininity, Salvaged","kicker":"CULTURE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BASSMAN, LILLIAN"},{"name":"subject","value":"PHOTOGRAPHY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2009-07-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ginia","lastname":"BELLAFANTE"}],"original":"By GINIA BELLAFANTE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26f698eb7c8105d82a3fc","word_count":1361},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/01\/12\/technology\/internet\/12blackberry.html","snippet":"Security experts and lawyers can come up with plenty of reasons for Barack Obama to surrender his beloved BlackBerry.","lead_paragraph":"Why can't the most powerful person in the world keep his BlackBerry?
