Her fixed expression of feigned surprise suggests she is willing to risk everything -- even wrinkles by the time she is 26 -- all for the art of pseudo-improvised reality television. ''The Hills,'' which recently concluded its fourth season, is MTV's ethnography of young people with enviable dentistry living in Hollywood and aspiring to careers that sociologists 50 years ago would have ascribed to the world of science fiction. Whitney had been courtier to Lauren Conrad's queen of the canyons until she decided to leave Los Angeles and a job at a company called People's Revolution, where she wore headsets and helped produce fashion shows. She was moving to New York to take up an offer to work as a publicity assistant at Diane von Furstenberg, a job Whitney describes early on in ''The City,'' a new series about her acclimatizing to Manhattan, as ''an opportunity of a lifetime.''

But, they say, the market for retail space in Manhattan should still fare better than the national market as a whole, especially compared with the suburban shopping malls. ''The national retail scene is a mess, and it is going to impact us,'' said Gene P. Spiegelman, an executive director in Cushman & Wakefield's retail services group. He predicted that demand for space would soften throughout the city's many shopping districts this year, and in fact, landlords in some of the trendiest areas have already begun lowering asking rents.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"More Manhattan Shop Windows Are Expected to Be Empty This Year","kicker":"SQUARE FEET"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2009-01-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"J.","middlename":"Alex","lastname":"TARQUINIO","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By J.
