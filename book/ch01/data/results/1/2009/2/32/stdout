In flusher times for the recording industry, you might have expected a freshet if not a flood of releases to wash over the Mendelssohn bicentennial, which becomes official on Tuesday. There are, to be sure, concerts here and about. The German organ virtuoso Felix Hell will perform Mendelssohn's complete works for the instrument in three programs on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday at the Church of the Transfiguration. Kurt Masur will conduct the New York Philharmonic in a program of Mendelssohn, including the Violin Concerto in E minor with Anne-Sophie Mutter as soloist, from Wednesday through next Saturday at Avery Fisher Hall.

Ms. Emin first gained notoriety in 1997 for her contribution to the famous ''Sensation'' show at the Royal Academy of Arts: a tent embroidered with the names of everybody with whom she had ever shared a bed. Soon after came an installation consisting of her bed itself, littered with blood-stained underwear, condoms and lubricant, which was shown at the Tate Gallery in 1999 and got her on the short list for the Turner Prize.","abstract":"British artist Tracey Emin comments on her huge popularity at home and not being as recognized in New York City, where exhibit of her works has opened at Lehmann Maupin Gallery; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/11\/14\/arts\/14emin_CA0\/thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/11\/14\/arts\/14emin_CA0\/thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/11\/14\/arts\/14emin_CA1\/articleLarge.jpg","height":400,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/11\/14\/arts\/14emin_CA1\/articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":400},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Quite Big In Britain, Not Quite In the U.S."},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"EMIN, TRACEY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2009-11-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"KONIGSBERG"}],"original":"By ERIC KONIGSBERG"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd274788eb7c8105d832e3e","word_count":1285},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/06\/03\/dining\/03lunch.html","snippet":"Zach Brooks is the founder and editor of Midtown Lunch, a Web site that serves those who toil in Midtown and hope to find something decent and reasonably priced to eat on their lunch breaks.","lead_paragraph":"A COUPLE of Fridays ago, the metal gates of Fashion Soup were pulled down and padlocked tight.
