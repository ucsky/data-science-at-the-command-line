Adjusting a detail on one of the scores of sequentially arrayed store dummies on Sunday afternoon, a Prada employee accidentally bumped it over.

Consider how often in this newspaper we've heard the groanings that unreal amounts of money, celebrity and marketing are knocking the more genuine stuff out of fashion. Yet even if the complaint seems valid, it is largely an older generation's reaction to the speed and inorganic nature of change, and not a result of our changing relation to what we wear. Fashion is not dead, but the world has slowed down and sobered up. Between last September and the start of the fall 2009 collections, on Feb. 5, merchants saw business fall dramatically as consumers shifted from spending to saving in the path of the recession. Magazines, faced with declining advertising, sent fewer editors to Milan and Paris. Fashion houses, anticipating reduced orders, cut out the theatrics as they sought to appeal to a relatively new demand in luxury fashion: value.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/03\/18\/fashion\/19wrap.1-500.jpg","height":500,"width":269,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":269,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/03\/18\/fashion\/19wrap.1-500.jpg","xlargeheight":500},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Two Words For Fall: Toughen Up"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MILAN FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARIS FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-03-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28a908eb7c8105d85cf88","word_count":1170},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/12\/fashion\/12runway.html","snippet":"Anna Sui is emblematic of the talented designers looking to survive with the big names.","lead_paragraph":"''IT'S survival of the fittest at this point,'' the designer Anna Sui said cheerily last week, as she glided around her Garment Center workroom, a space crammed with vintage mannequin heads, clothes racks, books and trimmings.
