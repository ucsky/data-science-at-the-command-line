(13, 49) CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS In March 1933, just two months into his first term, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent legislation to Congress intended to provide relief for one in four unemployed American workers through the conservation of natural resources. Over the next decade more than three million young men went to work in the nation's forests and parks, planting trees, building flood barriers, fighting fires and maintaining roads and trails. Corps workers lived like enlisted military personnel in camps and received $30 per month, $25 of which they were required to send to their families. This ''American Experience'' presentation, above, combines archival images with personal accounts from corps veterans to tell the story of this New Deal experiment. 7 A.M.

As Stephanie Syjuco, a San Francisco artist, talked to collectors on Wednesday, she busily wrote out invoices and swiped credit cards, all the while keeping an eye on a group of young artists who were diligently working at nearby tables. One of them, Claudia Djanbbari, was molding self-hardening clay into a coffee-table-size version of a South Korean artist's version of a Jeff Koons's ''Balloon Dog'' sculpture. ''I'm making a copy of a copy,'' Ms. Djanbbari said. The buyer, Mimi Brown, a collector who is based in Hong Kong, happily paid $243 for the miniature third-generation knockoff. The second generation, a commentary on the Koons work by the Korean artist Gimhongsok, was fashioned out of trash bags and cast in resin. It is prominently displayed at the Kukje Gallery stand, priced at $50,000. One of Mr. Koons's original ''Balloon Dog'' sculptures sold for around $20 million two years ago.","abstract":"Buyers are cautious and prices are down at Frieze Art Fair in London, although sales are up from previous year; many dealers are reverting to veteran artists whose sales are more reliable; leaner market has created niche for artists like Claudia Djanbbari, who appropriates work of other artists in low-cost reproductions; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/10\/17\/arts\/frie-ss-75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/10\/17\/arts\/frie-ss-75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/10\/17\/arts\/frie-650.jpg","height":437,"width":650,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":650,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/10\/17\/arts\/frie-650.jpg","xlargeheight":437},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/10\/17\/arts\/17frie.3371.jpg","height":240,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":240,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/10\/17\/arts\/17frie.3371.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Cunning After Caution at London Art Fair"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"DJANBBARI, CLAUDIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"SALES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRIEZE ART FAIR"}],"pub_date":"2009-10-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Carol","lastname":"VOGEL"}],"original":"By CAROL VOGEL"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28eff8eb7c8105d8662c3","word_count":1201},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/03\/08\/books\/review\/Shapton-t.html","snippet":"A book can be an ideal dinner date.
