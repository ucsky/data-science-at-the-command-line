Indeed, a lot of bargains await, including the lowest airfares in more than two decades and plenty of freebies like lift tickets and lodging for kids. So while a membership to the Caribou Club may be out of reach for many, Aspen's four champagne-powder mountains aren't. HOW TO GET THERE Flying into Aspen (with a plane change in Denver) from New York City just got cheaper thanks to Frontier, which began competing with United and Delta on that route in 2008. A recent Web search showed round-trip flights on Frontier from La Guardia Airport starting at $320 for travel in January.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/12\/11\/travel\/13aspenspan-1\/thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/12\/11\/travel\/13aspenspan-1\/thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/12\/11\/travel\/13aspenspan-1\/articleLarge.jpg","height":331,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/12\/11\/travel\/13aspenspan-1\/articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":331},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Affordable Skiing: Aspen","kicker":"SKI GUIDE 2010"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"ASPEN (COLO)"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2009-12-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Meredith","middlename":"C.","lastname":"CARROLL","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By MEREDITH C.
