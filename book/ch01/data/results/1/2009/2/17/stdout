Heidi Mount, at right, from Centerville, Utah, is a new favorite of Karl Lagerfeld. Last year, she opened the Chanel spring ready-to-wear show and has appeared in consecutive Chanel ads (sorry, Claudia Schiffer). A new Dolce & Gabbana campaign, photographed by Steven Klein, confirms that the 22-year-old is on the rise. A rare American among the countless Brazilians and Russians who are using the runway for takeoff, Ms. Mount said that most American models don't fit the industry's stick-figure standards: ''It might have something to do with diet and nutrition at an early age.'' But the requirements for success (''a thick skin, the drive to keep going and a good personality'') are universal, she said.
