(Well, maybe not the murder part.) And part of the appeal of ''Rage,'' a new film by the British director Sally Potter, best known for the 1992 film ''Orlando,'' is the way it manages to convey the tense minimalist theater of a fashion show without ever depicting one. Made on a shoestring budget and starring an array of above-the-title actors, ''Rage'' (the title truncates ''all the rage,'' a phrase no one in fashion is likely to have uttered since the 1920s) may ultimately be less interesting for its cast than for its formal conceits and its distribution plan.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/rage.75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/rage.75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/rage.span.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/rage.span.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"A Movie Reveals a Lot by Eliminating the Fashion","kicker":"FASHION DIARY"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MODELS (PROFESSIONAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MURDERS AND ATTEMPTED MURDERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-09-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Movies; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Guy","lastname":"TREBAY"}],"original":"By GUY TREBAY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28b2c8eb7c8105d85e7e4","word_count":751},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/04\/fashion\/04iht-ffuchs.html","snippet":"Some new designers call the 80-year-old Elio Berhanyer old-fashioned, but others say he\u2019s a hero to his country","lead_paragraph":"MADRID -- The designer is fuming.

Their efforts, unveiled at Don Hill's, a downtown club, were part of Style Wars, a competition produced by the House of Diehl, a New York design firm. The point, Mary Jo Diehl said, was to give the young a chance to shine under pressure. ''In a dream world you've got six months and a bolt of Italian silk to make a dress,'' she said. ''In the real world your resources and deadlines are tighter than Shrek in a Speedo.'' Two of the judges, the models Elettra Wiedemann (top right) and Jenny Shimizu (near right), tried to keep open minds. Ms. Shimizu hoped she could spot talent at a glance. ''I'm watching for the energy,'' she said. ''That's what's most attractive.''","abstract":"House of Diehl presents Style Wars, fashion design competition at downtown Manhattan nightclub Don Hill's; photos (M)","print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Of the Moment, in a Moment","kicker":"LIFE AS A RUNWAY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DON HILL'S"},{"name":"organizations","value":"HOUSE OF DIEHL"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-11-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ruth","lastname":"LA FERLA"}],"original":"By RUTH LA FERLA"},"type_of_material":"Caption","_id":"4fd28c998eb7c8105d8616af","word_count":145},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/06\/24\/milan-fashion-lifes-a-movie-fashion-too\/","snippet":"MILAN -- While journalists, buyers and groupies continue to argue over whether fashion should be more realistic and affordable or, on the other hand, more creative and experimental, the designers showing their spring\/summer 2010 collections in Milan...","lead_paragraph":"MILAN -- While journalists, buyers and groupies continue to argue over whether fashion should be more realistic and affordable or, on the other hand, more creative and experimental, the designers showing their spring\/summer 2010 collections in Milan are throwing yet another question into the fray: Black and white or in Technicolor?","abstract":"MILAN -- While journalists, buyers and groupies continue to argue over whether fashion should be more realistic and affordable or, on the other hand, more creative and experimental, the designers showing their spring\/summer 2010 collections in Milan are throwing yet another question into the fray: Black and white or in Technicolor?","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Milan Fashion | Life's a Movie.

The hordes descending on Bryant Park last week were combat-ready, jostling their way through crowds clad in leather and steel. The spirit of aggression that surfaced on runways as early as a year ago reared its head last week behind the scenes, where models and onlookers were encased in biker jackets, battle boots and jet-toned jeans. At the Monarchy show, Kate Lanphear (far left, bottom) heeded the call to arms, her wrists festooned in spikes and chains. Backstage at Vena Cava (below), stylists dressed uniformly in tough boots, nailheads and fatigues.
