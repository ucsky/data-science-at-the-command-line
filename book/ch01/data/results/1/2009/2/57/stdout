For this issue, she headed to the island of Patmos, Greece, to capture its muted, rose-tinged light; stark, whitewashed walls; and saturated blues (''Rock of Ages,'' Page 104). A native of Sweden whose work has appeared in Vogue, Num\u00e9ro and Harper's Bazaar (an example of her fashion photography is at near right), Akrans typically finds herself in Los Angeles one week and New York, Paris, Cape Town or Hawaii the next. Happily, she recently completed renovations on a country house outside Stockholm. ''I hope I'm going to have time to enjoy it,'' she says, ''since I live mostly out of a suitcase.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"CONTRIBUTORS"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2009-05-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Travel Magazine","section_name":"Travel; Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ursula","lastname":"LIANG"}],"original":"By URSULA LIANG"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26f648eb7c8105d829eb4","word_count":602},{"web_url":"http:\/\/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/03\/30\/men-wearing-skirts-for-a-cause\/","snippet":"A fashion show, a lecture on the future of bankruptcy, or, for something light, painting in Coney Island.","lead_paragraph":"Monday, 7:30 p.m. The Male Unbifurcated Garment movement began in the early 1990s, when a cross-dressing Swede named Roger Lewau launched a now-defunct Web site called the Skirts Lover Nest. Over the years, the movement has strived for civil rights in displays of pride that have included a march down Fifth Avenue, where dozens showed up in minis, tutus and full-length crimson ball gowns. Now comes \"Dressed to Kilt,\" a fashion show hosted by the M.U.G.-wearing Scotsman Sean Connery. The models will include Andie MacDowell, the actress; Marcus Schenkenberg, the supermodel; and Robert Anderson, named in the show's promotional material as a \"Scottish Hunk.\" Proceeds will benefit the Friends of Scotland, but M.U.G. men around the world will surely take note.

As if to prove the principle, two of the most successful franchises in nonfiction hit the list with new offerings. Malcolm Gladwell's ''What the Dog Saw'' enters at No. 3, while Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner land at No. 2 with ''SuperFreakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes, and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance.'' (Also too big to fail, apparently: ''Big Man'' by Clarence Clemons, No. 13, and Timothy Egan's ''Big Burn,'' No. 15.) ''SuperFreakonomics'' may have been a surefire hit, but some are wearying of Levitt and Dubner's breezy contrarianism. Their chapter on climate change provoked an explosion of criticism from environmentalists and scientists, including one who said the authors had seriously misrepresented his views to support their claim that carbon dioxide isn't as big a problem as we think and that the movement to halt global warming ''has taken on the feel of a religion.'' On Freakonomics, their opinion blog for NYTimes.com, the authors dismissed the charges of intellectual dishonesty as a politically motivated ''smear,'' but critics stood firm. ''Before people begin believing that the problem with 'SuperFreakonomics' is that it annoys environmentalists, let's be clear,'' the liberal blogger Ezra Klein wrote. ''The problem with 'SuperFreakonomics' is, it prefers an interesting story to an accurate one.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"34","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Inside the List","kicker":"TBR"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}],"pub_date":"2009-11-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jennifer","lastname":"SCHUESSLER"}],"original":"By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28c968eb7c8105d8613ca","word_count":487},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9A00E7DA1E3BF93BA35750C0A96F9C8B63","snippet":"INTERNATIONAL     ZIMBABWE OPPOSITION PARTY  ","lead_paragraph":"INTERNATIONAL ZIMBABWE OPPOSITION PARTY","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"INSIDE THE TIMES: March 8, 2009"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2009-03-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Summary","_id":"4fd26ef78eb7c8105d829409","word_count":1273},{"web_url":"http:\/\/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/04\/a-ghost-bike-mystery-in-washington-heights\/","snippet":"The appearance of a white bike, chained to a city rack on 168th Street in Washington Heights, prompted questions.","lead_paragraph":"Is a white bike always a ghost bike?","abstract":"The appearance of a white bike, chained to a city rack on 168th Street in Washington Heights, prompted questions.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Ghost Bike Mystery in Washington Heights","kicker":"City Room"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-08-04T11:19:13Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"N.Y. \/ Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3970b8eb7c8105d8cf33e","word_count":832},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/11\/24\/the-insider-luis-venegas\/","snippet":"Luis Venegas, the Madrid-based publishing phenom behind the magazines Fanzine137 and Electric Youth, shares his essentials.","lead_paragraph":"The Insider profiles emerging tastemakers in the fields of fashion, design, food, travel and the arts.
