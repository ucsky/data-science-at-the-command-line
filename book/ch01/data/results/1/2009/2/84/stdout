For any actor, learning lines requires considerable focus, but for Smith, who delivers every word of ''Let Me Down Easy,'' her one-woman show about health care and the body, it's like a mental martial art. ''So let me try just that part again,'' she said to an actress who was there to help her. Smith, a tall 59-year-old who had the loose, dark curls of a much younger woman, was seated, bent over with concentration, as she rehearsed the monologue of a boxer named Michael Bentt, one of more than 20 characters she depicts in the show. She was memorizing language from a recorded interview that she conducted with Bentt, which is how she typically creates her one-woman shows: replicating real people's conversation onstage, in excerpted form.","abstract":"Anna Deavere Smith, actress, playwright and advocate for justice, appears in Let Me Down Easy, one-woman show in which Smith documents experiences of 20 people dealing with health care issues; uses interviews to give authentic voice to characters; discusses her early passions fighting for race and gender equality and how she has evolved throughout her career; photos (L)","print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/10\/04\/magazine\/04smith-75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/10\/04\/magazine\/04smith-75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/10\/04\/magazine\/04smith-500.jpg","height":500,"width":407,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":407,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/10\/04\/magazine\/04smith-500.jpg","xlargeheight":500},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Can Anna Deavere Smith's One-Woman Play About Health Care Bring Other Voices to the Debate"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"LET ME DOWN EASY (PLAY)"},{"name":"persons","value":"SMITH, ANNA DEAVERE"},{"name":"subject","value":"REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"HEALTH INSURANCE AND MANAGED CARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"BLACKS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACTORS AND ACTRESSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"DISCRIMINATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEDICINE AND HEALTH"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"2009-10-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Health; Theater; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Susan","lastname":"DOMINUS"}],"original":"By SUSAN DOMINUS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd293208eb7c8105d86d3af","word_count":4631},{"web_url":"http:\/\/thequad.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/03\/28\/live-blogging-the-round-of-8\/","snippet":"The Quad will provide news and updates throughout the N.C.A.A. tournament's Round of 8.","lead_paragraph":"The Quad will be providing commentary and updates throughout the Round of 8 of the N.C.A.A. tournament from reporters in each region.

I am lying on my back on the grass, listening to the intermittent chirping of nearby birds; my eyes are closed, the better to savor the warmth on my face. As I soak up the rays I think about summers past, the squawking of seagulls on the beach and walking along the water with my daughter, picking out enticing seashells, arguing over their various merits. My mind floats away into a space where chronology doesn't count: I am back on the beach of my adolescence, lost in a book, or talking to my old college chum Bethanie as we brave the bay water in front of her parents' house in Connecticut, where she comes to visit every summer. In the 20 or so minutes of ''fresh air'' allotted after lunch (one of four such breaks on the daily schedule), I try to forget where I am, imaging myself elsewhere than in this fenced-off concrete garden bordered by the West Side Highway on one side and Riverside Drive on the other, planted with patches of green and a few lonely flowers, my movements watched over by a more or less friendly psychiatric aide. Soggy as my brain is from being wrenched off a slew of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications in the last 10 days, I reach for a Coleridgian suspension of disbelief, ignoring the roar of traffic and summoning up the sound of breaking waves.","abstract":null,"print_page":"30","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/05\/10\/magazine\/10depression.4-600.jpg","height":331,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/05\/10\/magazine\/10depression.4-600.jpg","xlargeheight":331},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"A Journey Through Darkness"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"ANOREXIA NERVOSA"},{"name":"subject","value":"PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGISTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEDICINE AND HEALTH"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEPRESSION (MENTAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ANXIETY"}],"pub_date":"2009-05-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Health; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Daphne","lastname":"MERKIN"}],"original":"By DAPHNE MERKIN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26e888eb7c8105d828369","word_count":8215},{"web_url":"http:\/\/thequad.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/03\/26\/live-blogging-the-round-of-16\/","snippet":"The Quad will provide news and updates throughout the N.C.A.A. tournament's Round of 16.","lead_paragraph":"The Quad will be providing commentary and updates throughout the Round of 16 of the N.C.A.A. tournament from reporters in each region.

The tools for this ritual included a pair of omnidirectional microphones, a digital mixing console and a hastily-procured set of teacups and saucers, but the magic was in the room itself. Studio Two at Abbey Road in London has changed very little since 1969, when Paul McCartney, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison recorded together for the last time. The Steinway upright McCartney played on ''Lady Madonna'' still stands in one corner, its middle keys worn to the wood. Sound-absorbing quilts hang in wide stripes down the whitewashed brick walls. The view from the control room on the second level is much as it would have been for George Martin, Giles's father, who oversaw the creation of nearly every Beatles album from this room. Giles held a slender finger to his lips, which turned up into a playful grin. He handed cups and saucers to three people nearby and mimed a sip. The others followed his lead, and a few feet away the microphones captured the small clattering sound of four people drinking tea. The odd recording session in March was one very small contribution to what Apple Corps -- the company still controlled by McCartney, Starr and the widows of Lennon and Harrison -- hopes will be the most deeply immersive way ever of experiencing the music and the mythology of the Beatles. The band that upended the cultural landscape of the 1960s is now hitching its legacy to the medium of a new generation: the video game.","abstract":"Daniel Radosh article profiles Giles Martin, who oversaw audio portion of video game The Beatles: Rock Band, set for release by Harmonix on Sept 9; Martin is son of legendary Beatles producer George Martin; attraction of music games is difficult to pinpoint; Paul McCartney suggests miming was always fun and widow of George Harrison says playing it reaches creative portion of brain; photos (M)","print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Making the Game","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2009\/08\/11\/magazine\/20090816-beatles-slideshow_index.html","rank":"2","height":700,"credit":"How \u2018Here Comes the Sun\u2019 and other scenes from the Beatles video game went from concept to screen.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight2":"700","MultimediaType2":"Slideshow","MultimediaUrl2":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2009\/08\/11\/magazine\/20090816-beatles-slideshow_index.html","MultimediaPopupWidth2":"750","MultimediaSummary2":"How \u2018Here Comes the Sun\u2019 and other scenes from the Beatles video game went from concept to screen.","MultimediaHeadline2":"Making the Game"},"type":"Slideshow","width":750},{"caption":"The Beatles: Rock Band","url":"http:\/\/video.nytimes.com\/video\/2009\/08\/11\/magazine\/1247463942234\/the-beatles-rock-band.html","rank":"1","credit":"The New York Times asked 'Bubble' - a Beatles tribute band - to demo a new video game called \"The Beatles: Rock Band.\"","legacy":{"MultimediaHeadline1":"The Beatles: Rock Band","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/video.nytimes.com\/video\/2009\/08\/11\/magazine\/1247463942234\/the-beatles-rock-band.html","MultimediaCol1":"MAGAZINE","MultimediaType1":"Video","MultimediaSummary1":"The New York Times asked 'Bubble' - a Beatles tribute band - to demo a new video game called \"The Beatles: Rock Band.\""},"type":"Video","col":"MAGAZINE"},{"caption":"Beatles for Sale","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/08\/12\/magazine\/20090812_BEATLES_GALLERY.html","rank":"3","credit":"As they were in so many aspects of their brief career, the Beatles proved to be pioneers in product licensing.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight3":"0","MultimediaType3":"Other","MultimediaUrl3":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/08\/12\/magazine\/20090812_BEATLES_GALLERY.html","MultimediaPopupWidth3":"0","MultimediaSummary3":"As they were in so many aspects of their brief career, the Beatles proved to be pioneers in product licensing.","MultimediaHeadline3":"Beatles for Sale"},"type":"Other"},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/08\/16\/magazine\/16beatles-600.jpg","height":347,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/08\/16\/magazine\/16beatles-600.jpg","xlargeheight":347},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"While My Guitar Gently Beeps"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"BEATLES, THE: ROCK BAND (VIDEO GAME)"},{"name":"persons","value":"MCCARTNEY, PAUL"},{"name":"persons","value":"MARTIN, GEORGE"},{"name":"persons","value":"HARRISON, GEORGE"},{"name":"persons","value":"MARTIN, GILES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"HARMONIX MUSIC SYSTEMS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BEATLES, THE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"HARMONIX"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"BEATLES, THE: ROCK BAND (VIDEO GAME)"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES"},{"name":"subject","value":"RECORDINGS AND DOWNLOADS (AUDIO)"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}],"pub_date":"2009-08-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Technology; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Daniel","lastname":"RADOSH"}],"original":"By DANIEL RADOSH"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2902a8eb7c8105d8681fc","word_count":8406},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/04\/12\/magazine\/12churches-t.html","snippet":"Missionaries from African churches are evangelizing around the globe. Can a Nigerian Pentecostal movement take root in American soil?","lead_paragraph":"PASTOR DANIEL AJAYI-ADENIRAN is coming for your soul. It doesn't matter if you are black or white, rich or poor, speak English or Spanish or Cantonese. He is on a mission to save you from eternal damnation. He realizes you may be skeptical, put off by his exotic name -- he's from Nigeria -- or confused by his accent, the way he stretches his vowels and trills his R's, giving his sermons a certain chain-saw rhythm. He suspects you may have some unfortunate preconceptions about Nigerians. But he is not deterred. He believes the Holy Spirit is working through him -- aided by the awesome earthly power of demographics. Africa is the world's fastest-growing continent, and Ajayi-Adeniran belongs to one of its most vigorously expansionary religious movements, a homegrown Pentecostal denomination that is crusading to become a global faith. In the course of just a few decades, the Redeemed Christian Church of God, founded in a Lagos shantytown, has won millions of adherents in Nigeria while building a vast missionary network that stretches into more than 100 nations. ''The rate of growth,'' Ajayi-Adeniran says, ''is becoming exponential.'' As the man coordinating the Redeemed Church's expansion in North America, the pastor spends his days shuttling from his home base, a storefront church in the Bronx, to the denomination's continental headquarters, a 550-acre compound in Texas, and to mission outposts scattered from Vermont to Belize. This places him at the vanguard of a revolution in worldwide Christianity, one that it is quite literally changing its face, as a faith that was once exported by white missionaries from Europe and America comes to draw its strength from the peoples of the Southern Hemisphere.","abstract":null,"print_page":"30","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Pentecostal Fire","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/04\/12\/magazine\/20090412-churches-audioss\/index.html","rank":"1","height":583,"credit":"In a Bronx parish Daniel Ajayi-Adeniran preaches a fiery form of Pentecostalism.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"583","MultimediaType1":"AudioSS","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"680","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/04\/12\/magazine\/20090412-churches-audioss\/index.html","MultimediaSummary1":"In a Bronx parish Daniel Ajayi-Adeniran preaches a fiery form of Pentecostalism.","MultimediaHeadline1":"Pentecostal Fire"},"type":"AudioSS","width":680},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/04\/12\/magazine\/12churches-600.jpg","height":385,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/04\/12\/magazine\/12churches-600.jpg","xlargeheight":385},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Mission From Africa"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ABACHA, SANI"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NIGERIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"RELIGION AND BELIEF"},{"name":"subject","value":"PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BLACKS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHURCHES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHRISTIANS AND CHRISTIANITY"}],"pub_date":"2009-04-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Andrew","lastname":"RICE"}],"original":"By ANDREW RICE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28cec8eb7c8105d862022","word_count":8068},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/02\/magazine\/02cooking-t.html","snippet":"How American cooking became a spectator sport, and what we lost along the way.","lead_paragraph":"1.

Some of the more ambitious dishes, like the duck or the mousse, were pointed toward weekend company, but my mother would usually test these out on me and my sisters earlier in the week, and a few of the others -- including the boeuf bourguignon, which I especially loved -- actually made it into heavy weeknight rotation.
