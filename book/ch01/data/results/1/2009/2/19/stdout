They may have suspected they were being manipulated, since the store, which opened at 478 Broadway on April 2, did not appear all that crowded. Still, they waited, and waited, and then they bought such items of this very moment as pink leopard-print dresses no bigger than a house cat, black leggings with fringe along the sides and sunglasses with lenses shaped like lips.

The campaign promotes the city ''as a rite of passage for the gay and lesbian traveler'' and is timed to coincide with the 40th anniversary of a defining moment in the history of gay rights, the Stonewall rebellion. Before Stonewall -- a clash of protesters and the police after a violent raid on a Greenwich Village bar in June 1969 -- the city was a gay destination, but certainly not one promoted by its officials, nor particularly welcomed by the wider public. Consider these excerpts from a front-page article in The New York Times in 1963 under the headline ''Growth of Overt Homosexuality in City Provokes Wide Concern.''

So, as New York's financial sector evaporates, Berlin provides some illuminating examples of what the arts may look like here in the near future.

Members of the public are invited to join with artists and other celebrities in graffiti-ing messages of hope on giant bricks, which will be shipped to Berlin, arranged at the former site of the wall and ceremonially knocked down domino-style on November 9.Tuesday evening offers a fashion showcase including emerging labels such as Unrath and Strano, as well as more established designers like Bernadett Penkov. Early arrivals will find a panel discussion with professors from Parsons facing off with their opposite numbers from Esmod Berlin on big fashion issues like sustainability and future business models.Wednesday evening features a screening of Hannes Stoehr's movie \"Berlin Calling,\" the story of the institutionalization of the touring techno D.J. Ickarus, who is played by the real-life techno D.J. Paul Kalkbrenner.

Mr. Curley, who also co-owns Cake Shop, a popular and laid-back cafe on the Lower East Side, said he and his partners chose Windsor Terrace because it's where they live, and, as he put it, there was ''not that much going on.'' During construction, passers-by frequently stopped at the site at 210 Prospect Park West to ask when the place would open, Mr. Curley said. And when it did, at 5 p.m. a week ago Wednesday, there was a line at the door. ''I feel like the smartest guy in the world, opening here,'' Mr. Curley said. LILY, a beloved women's clothing and accessories store that has enjoyed a brisk business in Cobble Hill for a decade, opened its second outpost, at 435 Seventh Avenue in August, 2007. Jennifer Gerien, the owner, said customers from their early 20s to their 70s were drawn to the accessibility of the shop, which is named for her grandmother. ''It feels like walking into your closet at home,'' Ms. Gerien said. ''That's what people have said to me.'' But sales at the second store in Park Slope have been flat in the last year, and six months ago, Ms. Gerien gave birth to her second child. ''It seemed like a lot of work, and it was draining away from the other business,'' she said.
