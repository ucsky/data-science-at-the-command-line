Shoes are no exception. Anything remotely square-toed is so past its ''sell by'' date that, well, if you see something, say something.

The forerunners of today's status sneakers, they became fashionable a century ago, fancier versions of the light crepe-soled shoes worn for the newly fashionable sport of tennis. The novel red sole came later, in 1934, helping ignite another vogue for them as part of the debonair Palm Beach look. They came back again in the clean-cut 1950s and again in the prep-crazed 1980s.
