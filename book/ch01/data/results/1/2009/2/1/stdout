Runway collections are now largely vehicles for promoting a big designer's image, or helping a new talent get started. You have to wonder then if a significant number of women will care that Donna Karan presented her best collection in years, or that Marc Jacobs channeled his favorite good times, the 1980s. For a while, Ms. Karan has been doing some rather confounding things to clothes, which in essence suggested that she was in a prolonged state of meditation. On Monday, she snapped out of it and showed some terrific clothes. From start to finish (well, almost), this was about as levelheaded a collection as you could expect from a serious designer and businesswoman.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Fashion Week Highlights","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/20090218-fashion-feature\/index.html","rank":"1","height":583,"credit":"Cathy Horyn narrates a slide show highlighting the standout designers of the fall 2009 shows.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"583","MultimediaType1":"AudioSS","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"680","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/20090218-fashion-feature\/index.html","MultimediaSummary1":"Cathy Horyn narrates a slide show highlighting the standout designers of the fall 2009 shows.","MultimediaHeadline1":"Fashion Week Highlights"},"type":"AudioSS","width":680},{"url":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/style\/18review_75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/style\/18review_75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/style\/18review_600.JPG","height":280,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/style\/18review_600.JPG","xlargeheight":280},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/style\/18review_337.jpg","height":240,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":240,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/style\/18review_337.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"In the Moment, or Not","kicker":"FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REESE, TRACY"},{"name":"persons","value":"KARAN, DONNA"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-02-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd2b4b18eb7c8105d8a706b","word_count":763},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/02\/20\/fashion\/20090222-fashion-wrap-feature\/index.html","snippet":"Cathy Horyn discusses which designers had their feet firmly planted, despite a recession, at New York Fashion Week.","lead_paragraph":"Cathy Horyn discusses which designers had their feet firmly planted, despite a recession, at New York Fashion Week.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Fashion Week Finale "},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":""},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2009-02-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a86671c22dfde670bf5eb","word_count":25},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/20\/fashion\/20DIARY.html","snippet":"The clothing designer Alexandre Herchcovitch finds hope and inspiration in economic crisis.","lead_paragraph":"Some designers look to hothouse decadents like the Marchesa Casati for their ideas.

For the Brazilian designer Alexandre Herchcovitch it's the tumult of cities that serves as inspiration, particularly that of S\u00e3o Paulo, the randomly evolved metropolis he calls home. ''I don't like this thing designers do of putting images up on a board,'' Mr. Herchcovitch said Wednesday before his show in Bryant Park.

I don't mean a designer for the thinking woman, but a thinking designer: one who has ascended to the top of American fashion by speaking to customers, as she says, ''woman to woman.'' Ms. Karan, perhaps more astutely than any of her colleagues, has taken into account that we are living in a mixed-up world, where people may care deeply about fashion but are not going to buy clothes just for the sake of shopping. For years, she has rightly pointed out that the overheated fashion industry was not helping itself by rushing coats into stores in the middle of summer so that they were bound to be on sale by the time anyone wanted them. But only now, during a crisis, are retailers taking her point more seriously. It helps that her most recent collections, including her spring show on Monday, have been excellent.","abstract":null,"print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Backstage Scenes","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/0915-BACKSTAGE_FW_index.html","rank":"1","height":700,"credit":"Backstage at several shows including Rodarte, Marc Jacobs, Thakoon, Matthew Ames, Vera Wang and Max Azria.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"700","MultimediaType1":"Slideshow","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"750","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/0915-BACKSTAGE_FW_index.html","MultimediaSummary1":"Backstage at several shows including Rodarte, Marc Jacobs, Thakoon, Matthew Ames, Vera Wang and Max Azria.","MultimediaHeadline1":"Backstage Scenes"},"type":"Slideshow","width":750},{"url":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/16dress-75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/16dress-75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/16dress-600.jpg","height":379,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/16dress-600.jpg","xlargeheight":379},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/16dress-337.jpg","height":250,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":250,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/09\/15\/fashion\/16dress-337.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Sense And Sensibility Restored","kicker":"FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BENZ, CHRIS"},{"name":"persons","value":"KARAN, DONNA"},{"name":"persons","value":"PANICHGUL, THAKOON"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-09-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"WILSON"}],"original":"By ERIC WILSON"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd2a1a58eb7c8105d886388","word_count":661},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/19\/fashion\/19REVIEW.html","snippet":"Reviews of the Michael Kors, Narciso Rodriguez, Sophie Theallet and Rodarte fall collections.","lead_paragraph":"Destruction is an interesting motif for fashion. The scratched and crumbling textures of Kate and Laura Mulleavy's dresses for Rodarte evoke toppled walls, broken concrete or shattered glass. The sisters from Pasadena, Calif., seem to have a thing for horror. They are good not so much in conceiving a look for a fashion collection as in responding to their impulses. You sense that the Mulleavys literally feel their way through a collection, touching the fabrics, carefully dyeing them and making tender collages from the bits that attract them. There are some remarkable assemblages in their new line, shown Tuesday: marbleized leather, flashes of silver and green, smoky wisps of black yarn, most mounted on nearly invisible chiffon so as to appear dissolving.","abstract":null,"print_page":"16","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Fashion Week Highlights","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/20090218-fashion-feature\/index.html","rank":"1","height":583,"credit":"Cathy Horyn narrates a slide show highlighting the standout designers of the fall 2009 shows.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"583","MultimediaType1":"AudioSS","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"680","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/20090218-fashion-feature\/index.html","MultimediaSummary1":"Cathy Horyn narrates a slide show highlighting the standout designers of the fall 2009 shows.","MultimediaHeadline1":"Fashion Week Highlights"},"type":"AudioSS","width":680},{"url":"images\/2009\/02\/19\/fashion\/19review_75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/02\/19\/fashion\/19review_75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/02\/19\/fashion\/19review_600.JPG","height":280,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/02\/19\/fashion\/19review_600.JPG","xlargeheight":280},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/02\/19\/fashion\/19review_337.jpg","height":220,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":220,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/02\/19\/fashion\/19review_337.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Surface Sheen, Subtle Thought","kicker":"FASHION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MULLEAVY, KATE"},{"name":"persons","value":"MULLEAVY, LAURA"},{"name":"persons","value":"RODRIGUEZ, NARCISO"},{"name":"persons","value":"KORS, MICHAEL"},{"name":"organizations","value":"RODARTE"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-02-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HOYRN"}],"original":"By CATHY HOYRN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd26ef58eb7c8105d82924b","word_count":757},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2009\/03\/18\/fashion\/20090319-wrap-slideshow_index.html","snippet":"Fashion is not dead, but the world has slowed down and sobered up.
