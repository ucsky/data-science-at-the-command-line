They liked his compact swing and his defensive instincts, but they also saw a 28-year-old minor leaguer who, before this season, had only 10 career at-bats. But over the last six weeks, Santos has turned a small sample size into sustained production, and now he has wrested the backup catcher's job from Ramon Castro. Minutes after Santos delivered his second game-winning hit in less than a week, the Mets announced they had resolved their catching surplus by trading Castro, their longtime backup, to the Chicago White Sox. In exchange, the Mets received the right-hander Lance Broadway and assigned him to Class-AAA Buffalo. The Mets will send the White Sox some money to offset the rest of the $2.5 million that Castro is owed in the final season of a two-year contract.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"After Another Big Hit, Mets Part With Castro"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2009-05-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ben","lastname":"SHPIGEL"}],"original":"By BEN SHPIGEL"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26d528eb7c8105d826e6c","word_count":875},{"web_url":"http:\/\/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/18\/stegners-complaint\/","snippet":"Wallace Stegner's centennial is a reminder of the respect writers from the American West don't get.","lead_paragraph":"PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Wednesday was the centennial of Wallace Stegner, the writer and uber-citizen of the West.
