And her departure could not have come at a more poignant moment: the opening of an exhibition in New York about the fashion model as muse. This case study, which is set to open Wednesday at the Metropolitan Museum, could be seen not just as a celebration for the magazine icons -- but also as a requiem, now that celebrity images have all but effaced the models. There will surely be a new generation of women who capture a cultural moment, just as the greyhound sophisticates of the golden era of haute couture were eclipsed by the child-woman fauns, personified by Twiggy, and ultimately by the Amazonian supermodels.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"International Herald Tribune","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/05\/04\/fashion\/modelmuse.75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/05\/04\/fashion\/modelmuse.75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/05\/04\/fashion\/modelmuse.600.jpg","height":370,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/05\/04\/fashion\/modelmuse.600.jpg","xlargeheight":370},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"An Ode to the Shooting Stars of Beauty"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"MODELS (PROFESSIONAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MAGAZINES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BEAUTY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-05-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Suzy","lastname":"MENKES"}],"original":"By SUZY MENKES"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26f6b8eb7c8105d82a68b","word_count":1076},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/11\/25\/business\/smallbusiness\/25growth.html","snippet":"Several entrepreneurs have found ways to increase revenue by tailoring strategies to their unique strengths.","lead_paragraph":"Many small businesses have found themselves treading water, at best, during the recession. But, that is not true for everyone. In fact, a significant minority of resilient companies have been able to do the seemingly impossible and increase revenue in these troubled times. According to a recent survey of 300 small-business clients conducted by SurePayroll, a payroll service based in Chicago, about 30 percent of respondents said their sales increased over the last year. How have they done it? Turns out, in a bad economy, successful small businesses tend to be successful in their own ways. In some cases, for example, the secret lies in offering customers more bang for the buck, and in others, it is in expanding overseas. The bottom line: for each company, the solution depends on a variety of factors, like business model and the industry.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Even in Recession, Some Small Businesses Grow"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"SALES"},{"name":"subject","value":"RECESSION AND DEPRESSION"},{"name":"subject","value":"SMALL BUSINESS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-11-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Anne","lastname":"FIELD"}],"original":"By ANNE FIELD"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd293148eb7c8105d86cd69","word_count":1090},{"web_url":"http:\/\/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/05\/20\/gay-marriage-slow-to-draw-an-opposition-in-ny\/","snippet":"Also in Morning Buzz: new design manuals for streets; absenteeism from continued swine flu panic; and other headlines from local papers.","lead_paragraph":"As the Legislature considers whether to make New York the next state to legalize same-sex marriage, social conservatives say they feel outgunned and underfinanced.","abstract":"Also in Morning Buzz: new design manuals for streets; absenteeism from continued swine flu panic; and other headlines from local papers.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Gay Marriage Slow to Draw an Opposition in New York","kicker":"City Room"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-05-20T08:56:38Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"N.Y. \/ Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By JENNIFER 8.
