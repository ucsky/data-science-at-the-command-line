It's the brainchild of the designer Sruli Recht and the artist Megan Herbert, and it's in a part of the Icelandic capital they're calling the fishpacking district. Which gives me a chuckle because a) center-city Reykjavik is barely large enough to be subdivided in the first place, and b) if Recht and Herbert are looking to capture a similar frisson of industria as Manhattan's meatpacking district, well, that neighborhood lost its frisson five years ago (if not before, in my worthless opinion).But anyway, who cares? Reykjavik designers and shop owners have proved themselves to be thriving and shrewd, economic woes notwithstanding, and they can be as creative with nomenclature as they like. Not long ago the city christened its main shopping street a \"design district,\" and Icelandic Fashion Week kicks off in the capital for the ninth time on Thursday. For his part, Recht, who was born in Israel, is something of an enfant terrible, with a goth-dandyish ethos that has won him international acclaim but hasn't taken him far from the spirit of his adopted city. Check out his whalets - wallets made of minke whale or Nile perch skin - or his luxuriously shroudlike blankoat sweater knitted from Icelandic wool. And I'm obsessed with his bow tie (below) and its backstory. At the new shop, these and other \"nonproducts\" - a new one every month - will sit alongside Herbert's illustrated paper-cut works. If you don't plan on being in Iceland anytime soon, some of Recht's pieces are available at BBlessing in New York and at Isetan in Tokyo.","abstract":"Last week, I heard about the opening of a new shop in Reykjavik, Iceland, called the Armoury.

Standout artists on display include Ronnie Bass, represented by the New York-based gallery I-20; Bass scored, directed and starred in his own music video, which offered a satirical take on the retro aesthetic of 1980s New Wave and New Romantic bands. Another name to watch is the conceptual photographer Veronika Kellndorfer, represented by Christopher Grimes Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif.
