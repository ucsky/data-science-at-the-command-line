The hedge fund crowd is sticking with the security of their uniform, even for bicycling to Wall Street. The bow tie is being revived just when dress-down Fridays threaten to spread to the entire week. Other signs of a returning formality: a lumberjack shirt worn with a tie and a Harris tweed vest, and a biker lightening his image by replacing the ubiquitous black leather jacket with a gray version.","abstract":"Photos of latests trends in men's fashion seen in New York City; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Standouts","kicker":"ON THE STREET"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-12-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"Cunningham"}],"original":"By Bill Cunningham"},"type_of_material":"Caption","_id":"4fd292988eb7c8105d86c015","word_count":93},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B05EFDA1F3FF936A25752C1A96F9C8B63","snippet":"The ginkgo trees are dripping in gold.

Stylish women are wearing many points of view -- so long as it's black with a touch of white. The really daring are accessorizing with red handbags and shoes. And some women confide they have not been able to resist buying new clothes after a year and a half of resorting to their own closets. Last week started with Indian summer weather and ended with blustery winds and showers, bringing out two seasons of fashion. Wednesday was Veterans Day and the flags lining Fifth Avenue called to mind Childe Hassam's paintings. The marchers gathered at Madison Square Park, where more than 100 Vietnam veterans roared by on motorcycles, taking the colors for a spin on Fifth Avenue.","abstract":"Women on streets of New York City use splash of color to add style to predominately black apparel; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Colors","kicker":"ON THE STREET"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"},{"name":"subject","value":"COLOR"}],"pub_date":"2009-11-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"CUNNINGHAM"}],"original":"By BILL CUNNINGHAM"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b5ba8eb7c8105d8a9269","word_count":146},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9F07E6DC113EF93AA15752C1A96F9C8B63","snippet":"Thanksgiving week is always exhilarating in the city.

This year New Yorkers could show off their autumn finery before the weather called for coats. Extremes of fashion are out, replaced by more functional styles. Celebrated New Yorkers rarely seen by day popped up, including, left, Judith Jamison, the artistic director of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater; left center, Sanford and Joan Weill, the philanthropists; and right, Carmen Dell'Orefice, the model. Legs, stockinged or in leggings, dictate the look. Winter shorts in corduroy or flannel, top right, were a big surprise. And Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was never seen to better advantage, thanks to its new zigzag route.","abstract":"New Yorkers don festive Thanksgiving attire for events around busy city, including famous Macy's parade; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Pre-Turkey","kicker":"ON THE STREET"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MACY'S"},{"name":"subject","value":"THANKSGIVING DAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARADES"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-11-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"CUNNINGHAM"}],"original":"By BILL CUNNINGHAM"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28c9b8eb7c8105d8617b9","word_count":110},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/09\/13\/us\/13merkin.html","snippet":"Mr. Merkin was a painter and illustrator whose fascination with the 1920s and 1930s defined his art and shaped his identity as a professional dandy.","lead_paragraph":"Richard Merkin, a painter and illustrator whose fascination with the 1920s and 1930s defined his art and shaped his identity as a professional dandy, died Sept. 5 at his home in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.

Designers' assistants dashed out for last-minute bolts of fabric and models rushed to fittings and bookings for shows, which continue through Sept. 17. Macy's Broadway windows were a parade of mannequins on a graffiti-covered dinner table. There's an old clich\u00e9 that with a few yards of fabric, designers can upset the whole world. But today, it's the shoe designers who turn things upside down. I saw two women in platform shoes without heels. They were walking on the balls of their feet. One of the women, Daphne Guinness, had to lean against a building so as not to fall over while waiting for her car and chauffeur.","abstract":"Women stride out in outrageous shoes to celebrate New York Fashion Week; photos (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Catwalk","kicker":"ON THE STREET"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOES AND BOOTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-09-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"CUNNINGHAM"}],"original":"By BILL CUNNINGHAM"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd274b08eb7c8105d8339c7","word_count":125},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/09\/14\/technology\/14youth.html","snippet":"Fashion blogs and blog networks are helping to give young entrepreneurs an early entry into journalism and winning some of them a place in the notoriously competitive fashion industry.","lead_paragraph":"At first glance, Dirrty Glam resembles any trendy online magazine.
