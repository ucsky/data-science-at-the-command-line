They are reminders of the attack on his company's residential compound five years ago that killed 22 people. Now Mr. Sanea is under a different siege, this time from the family he married into and which helped make him wealthy.

The embarrassing debacle of paying the state's bills with i.o.u.'s will come to an end -- at least for a while. Though Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger had pledged not to ''kick the can down the road,'' the budget he intends to sign today relies on $8 billion in accounting and revenue gimmickry, virtually guaranteeing another fiscal crisis next year. For states as well as families, hard economic times require difficult choices. But some states find themselves in budget battles even when they don't have the bad economy to use as an excuse. California is the prime recidivist, but since 2002, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin have also failed to close the deal on a budget on time.

For the most part these are titles that have already been issued by Criterion in stand-alone editions; they've been remastered here with a new menu design but without the extensive supplementary features for which Criterion has become justly famous. This time around it's just the movies, though the set comes with an abundantly illustrated 96-page book with an introductory essay and notes on each film by the Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince, as well as a personal reminiscence by Donald Richie, who was among the first critics to present Kurosawa to Western audiences.","abstract":"Dave Kehr article on DVD box set of 25 films directed by Akira Kurosawa, which honors his coming centennial; photos (M)","print_page":"17","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/12\/06\/arts\/06dvds_span-CA0\/thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/12\/06\/arts\/06dvds_span-CA0\/thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/12\/06\/arts\/06dvds_span-CA0\/articleLarge.jpg","height":330,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/12\/06\/arts\/06dvds_span-CA0\/articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":330},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Akira Kurosawa in a Box, Including Early Rareties","kicker":"DVDS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KUROSAWA, AKIRA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"JAPAN"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"RECORDINGS AND DOWNLOADS (VIDEO)"},{"name":"subject","value":"DVD (DIGITAL VERSATILE DISC)"}],"pub_date":"2009-12-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Dave","lastname":"KEHR"}],"original":"By DAVE KEHR"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a4b98eb7c8105d88b88b","word_count":1423},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/09\/22\/health\/22well.html","snippet":"A new dramatic series is challenging the conventional notions about dieting and willpower.","lead_paragraph":"Television has turned its lens on the overweight in recent seasons, mostly with reality shows like ''The Biggest Loser'' on NBC.
