Jose and his sons, who own one of the world\u2019s largest collections, are convinced that treating a few contemporary artists like commodities is smart business, even in a down market.","lead_paragraph":"On Monday, Sept. 15, mere hours after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy in New York City, Sotheby's was throwing open the doors of its London headquarters for the most extravagant sale in the auction house's history. The sale, of 223 new artworks by Damien Hirst, brought in more than $200 million -- nearly 10 times the total receipts of the previous record-holder for a single artist, a 1993 auction of 88 Picassos that reaped around $20 million. It was a level of consumption that, particularly when viewed against the concurrent collapse of the financial-services industry, almost immediately acquired a nostalgic air, the last gasp of the art boom. In the audience sat the men of the Mugrabi family -- the patriarch Jose and his sons, Alberto and David -- New York art dealers for whom the evening was not so much a transitional moment as simply another high-stakes day at the office. The Mugrabis own what is believed to be one of the largest and most valuable private collections of art in the world. By their estimate, it includes more than 3,000 works. They have built the collection over the past 25 years, since Jose, an Israeli-born fabric merchant who raised the family in Colombia, moved his wife, Mary, and their two sons to America and got into the art business full time.","abstract":null,"print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/03\/01\/magazine\/01brothers-75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/03\/01\/magazine\/01brothers-75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/03\/01\/magazine\/01brothers-650.jpg","height":504,"width":650,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":650,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/03\/01\/magazine\/01brothers-650.jpg","xlargeheight":504},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Is Anybody Buying Art These Days?"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"PRINCE, RICHARD"},{"name":"persons","value":"WESSELMANN, TOM"},{"name":"persons","value":"WARHOL, ANDY"},{"name":"persons","value":"HIRST, DAMIEN"},{"name":"persons","value":"KOONS, JEFF"},{"name":"persons","value":"BASQUIAT, JEAN-MICHEL"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SOTHEBY'S"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CHRISTIE'S"},{"name":"subject","value":"COLLECTORS AND COLLECTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"AUCTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2009-03-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"KONIGSBERG"}],"original":"By ERIC KONIGSBERG"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28ba98eb7c8105d85fa44","word_count":5319},{"web_url":"http:\/\/roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/27\/pedestrian-malls-back-to-the-future\/","snippet":"Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants cars barred from several blocks of Broadway, including Herald Square and Times Square.
