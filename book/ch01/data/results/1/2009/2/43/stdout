On Wednesday the media Web site Babelgum.com said it would release a new feature film, ''Rage,'' by the director Sally Potter, in episodes via an application for iPhones and iPods. Publicists for Babelgum said in a news release that the first episode of the film, a behind-the-scenes story about a New York fashion show, would be available on Sept. 21. Subsequent installments of the movie, which features Judi Dench, Eddie Izzard and Jude Law, will be released each day for the rest of that week. ''Rage,'' which was written and directed by Ms. Potter (''Orlando''), had its premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival. For younger audiences the independent publisher WingedChariot Press said it was releasing ''The Surprise,'' an interactive children's story by the Dutch artist Sylvia Van Ommen, for iPhone devices. It is the first entry in an expected series the publisher calls Stories to Touch.","abstract":"Media Web site Babelgum.com says it will release new feature film Rage, directed by Sally Potter, in episodes via application for iPhones and iPods (S)","print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Apps For Indie Films and Children's Books","kicker":"ARTS, BRIEFLY"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"RAGE (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"POTTER, SALLY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BABELGUM"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"IPHONE"},{"name":"subject","value":"RECORDINGS AND DOWNLOADS (VIDEO)"},{"name":"subject","value":"IPOD"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}],"pub_date":"2009-09-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Technology; Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Dave","lastname":"ITZKOFF"}],"original":"Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28b308eb7c8105d85eb4a","word_count":177},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/20\/looming-in-taiana-giefer\/","snippet":"Taiana Giefer is only 21 years old, but her edgy, felted merino wool textiles are already on the radar of some pretty influential fashion folk.

Francisco Costa collaborated with the New York-based designer on custom fabrics for his fall Calvin Klein collection, and Rick Owens liked her cloud-soft creations so much that he decided to sell them at his Paris boutique. Giefer -- whose boyfriend is the artist and Abraxas Rex jewelry designer Paris Kain -- also sells her hand-woven scarves, throws and blankets at Maxfield in Los Angeles. Each richly textured piece is one of a kind and takes up to a week to make. \"I love creating things that are new and innovative, but really show off the handwork that went into them,\" she says. Get them while they're relatively affordable: prices start at $300 for a small scarf and go up to $3,000 for a large blanket or tapestry.

''People call me that with such respect,'' she said, ''but I still look at myself as an adolescent.'' Of course, there is also a ballad about Serge, portraying him as a ghost at the window.
