Well, if the jeans fit...","lead_paragraph":"Ten days after Don Fisher's death, it was not just the presence of the man you could feel in his office but also the power of his simple idea. The picture window on the 15th floor of the Gap's corporate headquarters opened onto a giant bow-and-arrow sculpture that Fisher and his wife had commissioned for Rincon Park as well as a million-dollar view of San Francisco Bay, where cargo ships as brightly colored as Gap T-shirts crossed under the Bay Bridge. His desk, an uncluttered Jules Leleu knockoff, was bare but for a phone, a mechanical pencil and a pad scribbled with lunch dates and unreturned calls. Also reclining there: an atypical wooden figure by Alexander Calder, circa 1928, the earliest piece in Fisher's major collection of contemporary art. The founder of the largest American clothing company was as eager to make a competition of art expertise as he had been of the apparel business, and any visiting curator or sculpture maven could expect a pop quiz: who do you think made that? In 13 years, only two people had guessed correctly. The lower floors of the Robert A. M. Stern-designed headquarters were a warren of executive offices, most of which could double for a Gap store in a pinch. The atrium in the lobby had been constructed around a 60-foot-high, four-sided Richard Serra sculpture -- 118 radiantly enigmatic tons of rusted steel whose reverberant interior moved the rock star and Gap collaborator Bono to serenade the company's art specialist, Laura Satersmoen, with the aria ''Nessun dorma'' from Puccini's ''Turandot.''","abstract":"Article on The Gap retail chain as it celebrates its 40th anniversary; photos (L)4","print_page":"137","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/12\/06\/t-magazine\/06well-gap2\/thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/12\/06\/t-magazine\/06well-gap2\/thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Generation Gap"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"GAP INC"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOPPING AND RETAIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"JEANS (APPAREL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-12-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Holiday Magazine","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Chip","lastname":"BROWN"}],"original":"By CHIP BROWN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2980b8eb7c8105d874ee1","word_count":2989},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B07EFDC173FF934A1575AC0A96F9C8B63","snippet":"Television     Mike Hale  ","lead_paragraph":"Television Mike Hale","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE WEEK AHEAD | SEPT. 27--OCT. 3"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2009-09-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Mike","lastname":"HALE"}],"original":"By MIKE HALE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd274ac8eb7c8105d83369a","word_count":267},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/16\/nyregion\/16open.html","snippet":"On Orchard Street, a new store for denim connoisseurs opens, while a women\u2019s accessories store closes after 30 years in business.","lead_paragraph":"SELF EDGE, at 157 Orchard Street, is described by its owners as ''a store for those who have a passion for denim and its nuances.'' One of those nuances is price: The jeans run from $165 to $380, which will land you a heavy but soft pair of Iron Heart trousers with sterling silver rivets. They are made from what the store's owners call ''the world's finest denim,'' a fabric made in Japan with shuttle looms used in the good old days of classic American jeanmaking. Shirts run from $120 to $300. The narrow storefront is wedged between two decidedly old-school fixtures -- Orchard Corsets, a place teeming with cardboard boxes of bras and girdles that are custom-tailored for customers, and Belraf Fabrics, whose sign says simply, ''Trimmings Buttons Notions.'' Self Edge fetishizes the tough, simple styles of the old American West and work clothes, turning them into denim ''delicacies.'' One of the owners, Kiya Babzani, who opened his first Self Edge store in the Mission district of San Francisco, summed up the concept: ''It's Americana clothing through the eyes of the Japanese.'' BONNIE'S NEW YORK, a women's accessories store, stood for 30 years at 117 Orchard Street, with Fine & Klein Handbags just to the north. Known for its jewelry, hats and evening jackets, it was run by its owner, Bonnie Weinstein, who said she began selling jewelry on Orchard Street from a counter in a friend's bra and girdle store. That is according to a statement on her Web site; the site last week made no mention of the store's closing, which, according to several neighbors, happened abruptly two weeks ago. ''It was the rent that killed her,'' said a man on Wednesday who identified himself as the superintendent of the building that housed the store. (He would give only his first name: Jay.) He played for a reporter a voice mail on his cellphone: ''Bonnie, from Bonnie's New York,'' instructing him to reclaim the store keys. ''It's sad, man,'' he said. ''Bonnie was one of the old-timers on the block.'' The store was emptied out, and callers to its listed number were directed elsewhere. Ms. Weinstein did not answer e-mail messages or phone messages left for her at the Lower East Side Business Improvement District, where she was a board member.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/08\/16\/nyregion\/16open-650.jpg","height":454,"width":650,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":650,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/08\/16\/nyregion\/16open-650.jpg","xlargeheight":454},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Chronicle of a Changing City","kicker":"OPEN & SHUT"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LOWER EAST SIDE (NYC)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOPPING AND RETAIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"JEANS (APPAREL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FASHION AND APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-08-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Corey","lastname":"KILGANNON"}],"original":"By COREY KILGANNON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29be68eb7c8105d87c5d6","word_count":387},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/05\/03\/sports\/baseball\/03mets.html","snippet":"Another miserable outing Saturday left Oliver Perez embarrassed and General Manager Omar Minaya considering yanking him from the rotation.","lead_paragraph":"The Mets have a $36 million problem on their hands, and his name is Oliver Perez. Another miserable outing Saturday, his fourth in five starts, left Perez embarrassed, Manager Jerry Manuel discouraged and General Manager Omar Minaya frustrated and strongly considering yanking Perez from the rotation and sending him to the minor leagues. After the Mets' 6-5 loss in 10 innings to the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, the winning run forced in by a bases-loaded walk by Sean Green, Minaya said he would meet with his staff to decide Perez's fate. Perez's next scheduled turn comes Thursday in New York against the same Philadelphia team he once dominated but could not handle Saturday, when he allowed four runs and walked six in two and one-third innings. But it is doubtful the Mets will let him pitch. Of his 77 pitches, Perez threw 41 balls. He has walked almost a batter per inning this season: 21 in 21 2\/3 innings. His earned run average ballooned to 9.97.

There are epistolary novels and those in the form of diaries, wordless picture novels, graphic novels and novels written as dictionaries and encyclopedias. The Serbian writer Milorad Pavic may win the prize: he has attempted novels disguised as a crossword puzzle, a tarot book and even a clepsydra, an ancient water clock (at least conceptually; the pages are dry). That a work of fiction has now assumed the form of an auction catalog could be seen as a sign of the times -- deeply materialistic and, with a big recession on, increasingly for sale. But the artist and writer Leanne Shapton said that the idea for her novel, being published this week by Farrar Straus & Giroux under the unwieldy title ''Important Artifacts and Personal Property From the Collection of Lenore Doolan and Harold Morris, Including Books, Street Fashion, and Jewelry,'' came to her because she noticed how the lot descriptions in some estate catalogs added up to elliptical plots about the lives of the former possessors.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Objects of Desire, Up For Sale","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2009\/02\/03\/arts\/design\/20090205-catalog-slideshow_index.html","rank":"1","height":700,"credit":"\"Artifacts\" from Leanne Shapton\u2019s novel in the form of an auction catalog, chronicling a failed relationship.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"700","MultimediaType1":"Slideshow","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"750","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2009\/02\/03\/arts\/design\/20090205-catalog-slideshow_index.html","MultimediaSummary1":"\"Artifacts\" from Leanne Shapton\u2019s novel in the form of an auction catalog, chronicling a failed relationship.","MultimediaHeadline1":"Objects of Desire, Up For Sale"},"type":"Slideshow","width":750},{"url":"images\/2009\/02\/05\/books\/catalog-75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/02\/05\/books\/catalog-75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/02\/05\/books\/catalog-600.jpg","height":350,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/02\/05\/books\/catalog-600.jpg","xlargeheight":350},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"A Novelist's Catalog Of Lives On the Block"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"IMPORTANT ARTIFACTS AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE COLLECTION OF LENORE DOOLAN AND HAROLD MORRIS, INCLUDING BOOKS, STREET FASHION, AND JEWELRY (BOOK)>"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"IMPORTANT ARTIFACTS AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE COLLECTION OF LENORE DOOLAN AND HAROLD MORRIS, INCLUDING BOOKS, STREET FASHION, AND JEWELRY (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"SHAPTON, LEANNE"},{"name":"subject","value":"AUCTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2009-02-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Randy","lastname":"KENNEDY"}],"original":"By RANDY KENNEDY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd298ff8eb7c8105d87654e","word_count":1037},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/09\/06\/sports\/football\/06plank.html","snippet":"Doug Plank wore the jersey number and Coach Buddy Ryan selected it for the strategy that changed football.","lead_paragraph":"With his wrinkled hand, Buddy Ryan began to sketch on a notepad the defense he made famous.
