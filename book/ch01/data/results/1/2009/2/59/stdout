Some of the vintage installments were created for television; others were intended as marketing tools to be shown at schools, churches and scout meetings. Highlights in this inaugural season include footage of Shea Stadium under construction and the final walk to the center-field clubhouse at the Polo Grounds by Casey Stengel, above, as well as interviews with Joan Whitney Payson, a founder and majority owner of the Mets, and the broadcasters Lindsey Nelson and Bob Murphy.

This two-hour program follows Cynthia Moss, the director of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, and her Masai team as they chronicle Echo's efforts to guide her family through drought and famine, defend it against predators and warriors, and, in what will be the last journey of her life, pass her crown to the next generation. 8 A.M.
