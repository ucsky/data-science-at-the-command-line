Her audience last month at Madison Square Garden, where Ms. Nicks sang with Fleetwood Mac, was clearly seduced by her come-hither\/keep-back performance.

Slipping into these funny little padded socklets was one of the best experiences of my week -- if not my year or my life. The socks come in black nylon and even lace, and are discreet enough not stick out of your shoe, though if they did you could always just smile and tell people they're Prada.","abstract":"Fashion editors are not as nasty as the media would have you believe.
