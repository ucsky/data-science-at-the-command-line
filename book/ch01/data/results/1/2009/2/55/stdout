Actually, that was the case for much of his career: Mr. Konitz, never the warmest or most ingratiating of jazz legends, has long had a fickle relationship with the spotlight. That probably says more about the spotlight than it does about his art, which has been consistent over the years, obstinately so. Now 82, he has settled into a late-career renaissance by renewing the same lines of inquiry he's had all along. Of course it helps that he keeps changing the context, or letting it change around him. Last week Mr. Konitz was at Birdland with an all-star quartet whose youngest member, at 39, was the pianist Brad Mehldau. This week he's working at Iridium with another intergenerational group, jointly headlined by the eminently gifted tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, who is 44. Without really trying, the engagement serves both as a tribute to Mr. Konitz's early style and a confirmation of his endless renewal.","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/12\/19\/arts\/19shiftready\/sfSpan.jpg","height":250,"width":395,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":395,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/12\/19\/arts\/19shiftready\/sfSpan.jpg","xlargeheight":250},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Spanning Generations While Sticking to Old Standards","kicker":"MUSIC REVIEW | THE LEE KONITZ-MARK TURNER QUARTET"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KONITZ, LEE"},{"name":"persons","value":"TURNER, MARK"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"JAZZ"}],"pub_date":"2009-12-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Nate","lastname":"CHINEN"}],"original":"By NATE CHINEN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd292948eb7c8105d86bccb","word_count":521},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/26\/fifth-avenue-to-tokyo\/","snippet":"\"There's a certain demand that's gone with the asset destruction and the job destruction,\" a New York store executive told me the other day.

Try as retailers might to entice customers into stores-with spiffy renovations at Saks and Bloomingdale's, some great-looking fall merchandise-there just isn't enough demand. Let's hope things pick up in September. As I've been out and about in stores (and I'm by no means done), I've been impressed with the selection. There is more to buy, in my opinion, than there was last August-and some better buys. Retailers and designers seemed to make an effort to have more dresses, for example, in the $750-to-$900 range. I noticed at Barneys a terrific Isabel Toledo jersey dress (maybe a reprise of an earlier style) for $850. And I loved all the trousers I saw around-full, pegged, skinny. And the shoes. Oh, I could go on. Sooner or later one collapses in defeat and joy before a sales counter.","abstract":"\"There's a certain demand that's gone with the asset destruction and the job destruction,\" a New York store executive told me the other day.
