And so began Chesley McLaren's burning ambition: to become a world-class fashion designer.For 12 years, she toiled away in the garment center. Work, work. Grumble, grumble. Those big, bad garmentos care about just one thing: money! So she swallowed hard and hung out a shingle. And presto, chango! She went bust. To feed her shapely frame and keep the creditors at bay, she had no choice but to sketch. And what do you know? Everything she drew looked French.Soon, Bloomingdale's was calling. And Bendel's. Paint windows for us! Make displays! Illustrate our ads! Her gay pictures also adorned storybooks and her own cute tome, \"Zat the Cat.\"One day, hired to draw guests at a party, Chesley felt self-conscious. I am the artist, she thought. But I do not stand out. So for the next soiree, she made herself a smock out of coarse muslin, with giant red stitches and big ruffled cuffs. Suddenly, the lady guests didn't give a hoot about the sketches. They only wanted to know: where could they buy her top?","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chesley McLaren's Storybook Ending","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-03-27T11:27:34Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Andy","rank":1,"lastname":"PORT"}],"original":"By ANDY PORT"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd394228eb7c8105d8c8c37","word_count":521},{"web_url":"http:\/\/runway.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/10\/06\/phoebe-gets-out-the-broom\/","snippet":"The pictures don't do justice to Phoebe Philo's first collection for Celine.","lead_paragraph":"Yesterday afternoon, around 4p.m., the Place Vend\u00f4me was so jammed with cars that it recalled photographs of the square when parking was permitted.
