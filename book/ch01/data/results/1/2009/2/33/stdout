Here, we feature the best backdrops we saw at the New York shows. Below, we talk with the mastermind behind Rodarte's tinfoil look. The Moment's Alexandra Marshall checks in with Alexandre de Betak.Name: Alexandre de Betak, founder, Bureau BetakHome base: New York City and ParisClients: Christian Dior, Victoria's Secret, Viktor & Rolf, Hussein Chalayan, Michael Kors, RodarteWhat's the hardest thing about designing fashion shows?You need make the show memorable, but you can't take away from the clothes. And you want to do something different and newsworthy, but you've got to stay within the image of the designer so people know where they are. I'm here to enhance the identity of a designer.What's the biggest technical nightmare of your career?I did a show for Victoria's Secret in 2002, and some PETA protesters jumped on the runway to protest Gisele. There was no fur in this show at all, so go figure. Gisele was amazing and continued walking as if nothing happened, but a moment after that there was this big flying fluorescent angels number. The models were meant to fly around really fast, and it was dangerous, so we had it all synched with a computer. But because of the protesters interrupting the show, we had to reboot the sequence and the whole thing got stuck. We had a flamenco guitarist waiting to descend from the roof of the Armory, and he had to wait up there in the hot roof, too. I don't know how no one got seriously injured. It only took 30 seconds to fix, but it was the longest 30 seconds of my life.Are there any show effects you try to talk people out of? Live animals? Little people with their hair on fire?Oh, people have asked for all of that. The only time I try to talk someone out of something is if it doesn't seem to be in the spirit of their collection. Or if they want me to do something I already did for another designer.What's your least favorite runway trend?The recession! It's all anyone wants to talk about. It's every other line in every review. It's a real situation we're all facing, but fashion isn't going to solve it. And now people expect the same production, but for much less money. That's hard but it also forces us to be more creative, and that's never a bad thing.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Runway Looks | New York's Best Sets","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-02-20T18:48:11Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alexandra","rank":1,"lastname":"MARSHALL"}],"original":"By ALEXANDRA MARSHALL"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd394538eb7c8105d8c92ee","word_count":562},{"web_url":"http:\/\/thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/12\/07\/q-and-a-on-obamas-afghan-plan\/","snippet":"Correspondents for The Times who contributed to an account of the decision-making behind President Obama's new strategy for Afghanistan are answering readers' questions.","lead_paragraph":"Correspondents for The Times who contributed to an account of the decision-making behind President Obama's strategy for Afghanistan are answering readers' questions Monday and Tuesday.","abstract":"Correspondents for The Times who contributed to an account of the decision-making behind President Obama's new strategy for Afghanistan are answering readers' questions.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Q. and A. on Obama's Afghan Plan","kicker":"The Caucus"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-12-07T17:01:46Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"THE NEW YORK TIMES","original":"By THE NEW YORK TIMES","person":[]},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3983d8eb7c8105d8d23b1","word_count":3527},{"web_url":"http:\/\/carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/12\/09\/oscars-new-math\/","snippet":"As the awards race begins to rev up, the new math of The 10 is beginning to sink in, and Oscar-watchers say it is more confusing than ever.","lead_paragraph":"The Bagger had a rare non-premiere night, affording time for some big-picture thinking and, more importantly, a trip to the gym (which is actually where the Bagger does all her best big-picture thinking).
