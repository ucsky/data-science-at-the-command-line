That used to be a fairly easy game. Remember the craze a few summers ago for flounced skirts? Now empty stores are testing everybody's instincts. What irresistible fashion will tempt women this year? The recession is also challenging young designers to be innovative -- and exposing those who are not. When the model Ali Stephens came out at the start of Diane Von Furstenberg's show on Sunday dressed in a leopard-print turtleneck with stretch jeans in contrasting red leopard and a grandfatherly camel cardigan and a big metallic green tweed coat thrown over the whole thing, she was essentially selling the idea that she was a member of fashion nation. She was defending every girl's right to look as if she just blew backwards through a carwash of products. If there had been a subtitle printed on the sunset backdrop of Ms. Von Furstenberg's show in the Bryant Park tents, it would have said ''I love to shop.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Fashion Week Highlights","url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/20090218-fashion-feature\/index.html","rank":"1","height":583,"credit":"Cathy Horyn narrates a slide show highlight the standout designers of the fall 2009 shows.","legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight1":"583","MultimediaType1":"AudioSS","MultimediaPopupWidth1":"680","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/20090218-fashion-feature\/index.html","MultimediaSummary1":"Cathy Horyn narrates a slide show highlight the standout designers of the fall 2009 shows.","MultimediaHeadline1":"Fashion Week Highlights"},"type":"AudioSS","width":680},{"url":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/17review.75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/17review.75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/17review.600.jpg","height":300,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/17review.600.jpg","xlargeheight":300},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"tiny_thumb","url":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/17review.hp.jpg","height":250,"width":337,"legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":337,"tinythumbheight":250,"tinythumb":"images\/2009\/02\/17\/fashion\/17review.hp.jpg","hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Dressing With Temptation as Your Guide","kicker":"FASHION"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VON FURSTENBERG, DIANE"},{"name":"persons","value":"CORNEJO, MARIA"},{"name":"persons","value":"HERRERA, CAROLINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"DRESSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEW YORK FASHION WEEK"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"2009-02-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Cathy","lastname":"HORYN"}],"original":"By CATHY HORYN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd284678eb7c8105d8538ab","word_count":964},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/19\/fashion\/19FASHION.html","snippet":"Reviews of the Chris Benz, Coventry, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Peter Som and Thakoon fall 2009 shows.","lead_paragraph":"Thakoon Panichgul, one of the most admired of the new generation of designers bringing spunk to American fashion, opened his fall show with a spare gray wool-felt jacket and ivory skirt that looked as old-fashioned as a Republican cloth coat.
