If you lived through the decade of excess, having skeletons from your closet paraded in front of you may not be the most satisfying fashion experience, but it is a moment that's impossible to ignore.A generation of new designers, and the young stylists and assistants behind many older ones, cannot stop looking back to the '80s for inspiration, whether it's to the mixed uptown\/downtown club kids of New York haunts like Pyramid and Danceteria or to the Eurotrash multitudes dancing at Le Palace and Bain Douche in Paris or at Divina and Plastic in Milan.Judging from the clothes sent out at Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, Gucci, Pucci and Roberto Cavalli, it's all about Maripol and Jerry Hall, Lydia Lunch and James White, Talking Heads and the perennial Grace Jones, who keeps spinning back into fashion's orbit like a never-ending 12\" disco mix.Which means that the golden age of pret-a-porter, of Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler, of Gianni Versace and Antony Price - and their signature big shoulders and open, dark sexuality signified by thigh-high boots, miniskirts, black biker jackets, studs and metal mesh - is having yet another moment in the fashion sun.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"It's All About ... the '80s, Again","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-03-02T18:01:42Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stefano","rank":1,"lastname":"TONCHI"}],"original":"By STEFANO TONCHI"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3947b8eb7c8105d8c993f","word_count":404},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9907E5DD1F3EF934A25751C0A96F9C8B63","snippet":"Audio excerpts from opera recordings that, in 1907, were carefully wrapped in wax and stored in lead and iron containers beneath the Paris Opera, left, with instructions that they should remain undisturbed for 100 years.

One hundred years later, the vault was opened, and the containers were exhumed, right. And, after lengthy examination, cleaning and digitizing of the records, EMI, the heir to the Gramophone Company that supplied the recordings in 1907, is reissuing them on three CDs.

One week it's a dull, gray (empty) office space, and the next week you'd think Imelda Marcos had just moved in. Right now, as we prepare for one of our spring shoots, we are particularly flush with Junya Watanabe's intricately twisted tops and skirts in soft ginghams and African-inspired prints, Marc Jacobs Mary Poppins ensembles, various sea-creature printed Prada pieces and amazing tulle tutu pantaloons from TAO. Not to give too much away, but the shoot we are planning will be the polar opposite of minimalism. Christian Louboutin and Repetto have livened up the flat lace-up and made them a coveted item for spring. Wouldn't they look charming with a spring dress?Marc Jacobs did this amazing leopard-print bag, modeled here by Stella, our freelance fashion assistant. Miu Miu produced beautiful hand-painted bags in quirky patterns, and Roberto Cavalli designed \"lady bags\" that are fit for a psychedelic Marie Antoinette tea party.These jackets are for the not-so-common man. Viktor & Rolf did a bold surrealist faux bois, while Ann Demeulemeester went to polka dots. Arguably the most obscure item currently in the closet, this Adam Kimmel Hawaiian jumpsuit has stopped many New York Times employees in their tracks as they pass by our department.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Closet Case | Spring, to the Max","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-02-09T16:37:18Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Lindsey","rank":1,"lastname":"GATHRIGHT"}],"original":"By LINDSEY GATHRIGHT"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd394678eb7c8105d8c9603","word_count":287},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/14\/chic-in-review-tory-burch-goes-to-queens\/","snippet":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.Buck, Joan Juliet\u2022 Former Vogue Paris Editor-in-Chief -- and former child star -- resumes acting career with a role in \"Julie and Julia.\" Imagine Anna Wintour running a cooking school.Cheap\u2022...","lead_paragraph":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","abstract":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.Buck, Joan Juliet\u2022 Former Vogue Paris Editor-in-Chief -- and former child star -- resumes acting career with a role in \"Julie and Julia.\" Imagine Anna Wintour running a cooking school.Cheap\u2022 New book examines the social cost of brands like Ikea and Forever 21; ruins guilty pleasure shopping for all of us.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chic in Review | Tory Burch Goes to Queens?","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-08-14T12:58:13Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Sarah","rank":1,"lastname":"LEON"}],"original":"By SARAH LEON"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd396f28eb7c8105d8cec1b","word_count":391},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/05\/21\/geek-chic-super-models-meet-comics\/","snippet":"On August 26, Marvel Entertainment, the home of Spider-Man, will publish Models, Inc., a mini-series that unites the comic world's most fashionable characters, including Millicent Collins, a.k.a.
