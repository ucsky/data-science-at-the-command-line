Sometimes he sounds half-serious, and who can blame him? His career has been singularly jinxed by natural disasters, runaway budgets, stubborn and uncomprehending studio heads. In 1999, trying to make a movie version of ''Don Quixote,'' he endured so many Job-like travails that his failures became the subject of an award-winning documentary, ''Lost in La Mancha'' (2002). At times ''The Imaginarium'' seemed similarly ill-fated. Halfway through, Heath Ledger, one of the stars, died of an accidental overdose. William Vince, the producer, died, after a long illness, just as the principal photography was finished. And while the movie was in postproduction and just about out of money, Mr. Gilliam was run over by a car outside a London restaurant and broke his back. ''The film gods were going for the triple,'' he said over lunch in New York last month. ''They got Heath, they got Vince, and they were coming after me.'' He broke into a gleeful, high-pitched laugh, something he does with great regularity.","abstract":"Article profiles filmmaker Terry Gilliam, whose new movie The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus opens soon; Gilliam says film gods have taken over his life and run it at their whim, causing him to be jinxed by natural disasters, runaway budgets and uncomprehending studio heads; photos (L)","print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Imagining With Terry Gilliam","url":"http:\/\/video.nytimes.com\/video\/2009\/09\/14\/movies\/1247464574391\/imagining-with-terry-gilliam.html","rank":"1","credit":"Terry Gilliam speaks about his visual style at work in \"The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus.\"","legacy":{"MultimediaHeadline1":"Imagining With Terry Gilliam","MultimediaUrl1":"http:\/\/video.nytimes.com\/video\/2009\/09\/14\/movies\/1247464574391\/imagining-with-terry-gilliam.html","MultimediaCol1":"MOVIES","MultimediaType1":"Video","MultimediaSummary1":"Terry Gilliam speaks about his visual style at work in \"The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus.\""},"type":"Video","col":"MOVIES"},{"url":"images\/2009\/12\/13\/arts\/13gilliam_span-CA0\/thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/12\/13\/arts\/13gilliam_span-CA0\/thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/12\/13\/arts\/13gilliam_span-CA0\/articleLarge.jpg","height":209,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/12\/13\/arts\/13gilliam_span-CA0\/articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":209},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Seeking Harmony With the Gods Of Cinema","kicker":"FILM"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"IMAGINARIUM OF DR PARNASSUS, THE (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"GILLIAM, TERRY"},{"name":"persons","value":"DEPP, JOHNNY"},{"name":"persons","value":"FARRELL, COLIN"},{"name":"persons","value":"LAW, JUDE"},{"name":"persons","value":"LEDGER, HEATH"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"}],"pub_date":"2009-12-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Charles","lastname":"McGRATH"}],"original":"By CHARLES McGRATH"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd275a18eb7c8105d83572d","word_count":1392},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/07\/20\/books\/20mccourt.html","snippet":"Mr. McCourt, a former New York City schoolteacher, turned his miserable Irish childhood into a Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, \u201cAngela\u2019s Ashes.\u201d","lead_paragraph":"Frank McCourt, a former New York City schoolteacher who turned his miserable childhood in Limerick, Ireland, into a phenomenally popular, Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, ''Angela's Ashes,'' died in Manhattan on Sunday.
