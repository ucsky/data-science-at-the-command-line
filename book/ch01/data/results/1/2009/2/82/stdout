Megan Fox is a fox. And not just in the way you might think if you've seen her in a tiny bikini in a men's magazine or leaning over the hood of a '76 Camaro in ''Transformers.'' Yes, Fox is beautiful and often scantily clad, but dozens of beautiful girls arrive in Hollywood every day who are more than happy to pose nearly naked. Unlike them, Fox has a quality that sets her apart: Fox is sly. Canny. A devoted student of stardom, past and present, she knows how to provide her own color commentary -- a narrative to go with the underwear. In the age of the 24-hour news cycle and hungry blogs, Fox has supplied a seemingly endless stream of tantalizing quotes. She has detailed her fling with a stripper named Nikita; compared Michael Bay, the director of ''Transformers,'' to Hitler; and revealed that she has her boyfriend's name tattooed ''next to my pie.'' Fox has a provocative way of describing any situation: her girl-on-girl kiss in her latest film, ''Jennifer's Body,'' is ''like crazy kiddie porn''; Disney's ''High School Musical'' is about pedophilia (if you watch it, as she did, after getting high); and the reigning heartthrob Robert Pattinson is too young and too pretty to be sexually compelling. ''I would eat Robert Pattinson,'' she said.","abstract":"Lynn Hirschberg profile of starlet Megan Fox who appears to have instinctive understanding of components that add up to celebrity in Internet age; after appearing in two Transformers movies in which true stars were robots, she created rebellious sexual persona and talked her way into limelight; her biggest challenge will be how to retain her popularity and success, especially in light of apparent box office failure of her new movie Jennifer's Body; she is not especially fashion conscious or interested in style, but instead is student of personalities and image; photos (L)","print_page":"57","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/11\/15\/magazine\/15cover\/thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/11\/15\/magazine\/15cover\/thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/11\/15\/magazine\/15cover\/sfSpan.jpg","height":480,"width":395,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":395,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/11\/15\/magazine\/15cover\/sfSpan.jpg","xlargeheight":480},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Stardom Becomes Her"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"JENNIFER'S BODY (MOVIE)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"TRANSFORMERS (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"FOX, MEGAN"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACTORS AND ACTRESSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}],"pub_date":"2009-11-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Movies; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Lynn","lastname":"HIRSCHBERG"}],"original":"By LYNN HIRSCHBERG"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd28c998eb7c8105d86163b","word_count":5185},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/02\/15\/travel\/15vesteraalen.html","snippet":"A winter cruise to the tiptop of Europe on the Arctic Sea sails past snowy fjords, towering mountains, northern lights and tiny fishing villages.","lead_paragraph":"SETTING to sea in a howling midnight blizzard may not have the same romantic resonance as sailing off into the sunset, but it does have a certain elegance all its own.

My ship, the Vesteraalen, was bound up the North Atlantic coast of Norway, with 34 stops to the tiptop of Europe on the Arctic Sea -- a voyage that promised snowy fjords, towering mountains, northern lights and tiny fishing villages.

It\u2019s no day at the beach.","lead_paragraph":"ON OSBORNE AVENUE in the village of Southampton, a cozy cedar-sided house peeks out over a modest hedgerow, a coy signifier of means in this storied summer retreat of New York's moneyed classes. A blue real estate broker's sign is planted at the foot of the driveway: the house is up for sale for the fourth time in eight years. Its churning transaction history tells the tale of a dizzying decade. In 2001, it sold for $460,000; two years later, it went for $850,000; and in 2006, after a substantial renovation, it turned over again, fetching $1.65 million. The current owners of the house, a young Manhattan couple, moved on to bigger things after a couple of summers, purchasing a $4 million home south of the Montauk Highway, about a mile closer to the shore. They put the house on Osborne Avenue up for sale again, asking nearly $2.2 million -- almost five times the property's market value at the beginning of the decade. The Osborne Avenue house hit the real estate market at the end of the summer of 2007, a season that can be said, with the benefit of retrospect, to have marked the sweaty height of a speculative fever. That was the summer that the average cost of a home in the Hamptons shattered the $2 million barrier, the one when Ron Baron, a mutual-fund manager, paid a record $103 million for a 40-acre oceanfront estate. At the time, there were already alarming signs of a downturn in the national housing market, as a crisis took shape in the subprime-mortgage sector and economists predicted a coming onslaught of foreclosures. But that didn't cause much worry in the Hamptons. The bubble might be bursting off in Sun Belt subdivisions, but not in the playground of the Wall Street elite. Prices were propelled upward by a tautological justification: if you were rich enough to buy in the Hamptons, you were, by definition, a superior judge of the market.","abstract":null,"print_page":"65","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2009\/03\/15\/magazine\/15hamptons-75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2009\/03\/15\/magazine\/15hamptons-75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2009\/03\/15\/magazine\/15hamptons-500.jpg","height":500,"width":509,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":509,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2009\/03\/15\/magazine\/15hamptons-500.jpg","xlargeheight":500},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Key | Spring 2009 | A Cold season in theHamptons","kicker":"KEY | SPRING 2009"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"SOUTHAMPTON (NY)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"HAMPTONS (NY)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCIAL BROKERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FORECLOSURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOUSING AND REAL ESTATE"}],"pub_date":"2009-03-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Andrew","lastname":"RICE"}],"original":"By ANDREW RICE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd284698eb7c8105d853ab3","word_count":4405},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/10\/04\/travel\/04wonderland.html","snippet":"A nine-day trek on the 93-mile, aptly named Wonderland Trail in Mount Rainier National Park becomes a journey of discovery, of ordeal and of sheer survival.","lead_paragraph":"I AM not a camper by nature.
