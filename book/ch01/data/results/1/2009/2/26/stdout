On Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, good fortune came their way in an unusual fashion. Nik Antropov dived on his belly to score the go-ahead goal in a vital 3-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens that pulled the eighth-place Rangers (91 points) to a point behind seventh-place Montreal in the Eastern Conference. In Philadelphia, Florida lost to the Flyers, 2-1, leaving the Panthers in ninth place with 89 points. The Rangers, the Canadiens and the Panthers each have two games remaining. The Rangers will play a home-and-home series with Philadelphia, Thursday at the Garden and in Philadelphia on Sunday.
