(TLC) ON THE FLY Serving more than 100 million passengers each year, Southwest is among the country's busiest airlines. This new reality series goes behind the scenes, to the gates and in the air as it chronicles encounters -- pleasant and not so -- between customers and employees like Laycee Stupnik, above. In this premiere episode, a passenger in a wheelchair is upset about missing her flight; another is planning a proposal for his girlfriend, a flight attendant; and yet another is questioned about how much he had to drink at an airport bar. At 9:30, a woman takes her anger out on a supervisor after missing her connection because her previous flight was late. Then there are the requisite weather delays. 8:30 A.M. (USA) PIRATE RADIO (2009) The time: Britain in the mid-1960s, when the BBC, aided by the government, kept official radio channels mostly free of rock 'n' roll. The place: a tanker off the British coast, where rebel broadcasters (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans) blasted the Stones, the Kinks, Jimi Hendrix and the Who over the airwaves of a grateful nation. This angers a government minister (Kenneth Branagh) who wants to keep listeners safe with high culture and educational programming. The director, Richard Curtis, ''isn't concerned with exploring why gatekeepers might want to maintain the divide between high and popular culture,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''He wants to party. So he piles on the comic high jinks, lobs the jokes and cranks the splendid tunes.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-05-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kathryn","lastname":"SHATTUCK"}],"original":"By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"4fd2bba88eb7c8105d8b19e1","word_count":740}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
