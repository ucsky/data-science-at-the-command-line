Tireless photographers shot gorgeous and intimate behind-the-scenes pictures for the Photos of The Moment (shown here); Diane von Furstenberg (below), Ohne Titel (left) and Theyskens' Theory (above) were among the collections captured in these beautiful diaries. The Daily Shoe column (bottom left) featured one standout heel, boot or flat from the dozens that walked the runways every day. Editors tracked the making of five extraordinary dresses (Dress Code, center left), the ways two different women wore one single trend (Serene vs. Extreme, bottom right), and the transformative power of proper hair and makeup styling in Backstage Beauty Reports and the interactive Model-Morphosis stories. The fun continues in Europe, where shows are under way in London (Milan and Paris are up next). But first, here's a sampling from The Moment's busy, fashion-fueled week.

For a bit of street flair now, while it's too sultry for fur, how about a chic baseball cap? Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Rihanna were recently spotted wearing Kenzo logo caps; and now, in time for New York Fashion Week (and the baseball playoffs), Opening Ceremony has added a playful selection from Yestadt Millinery. Made with slightly elongated pony-hair brims, the caps come in black cashmere with a cheetah brim, black leather and black pony, and a bright scarf and cheetah print combo. Catch them in action in a video ( Pony! Poni! Pon\u00e9! on Vimeo) that Molly Yestadt, collaborating with Matt Kliegman, made with kids they found dancing on the subway. The Michael Jackson moves are suitable for an after-party.
