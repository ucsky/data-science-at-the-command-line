She meant nothing of the sort, as Christopher Lehmann-Haupt noted in his review in The Times, calling the book a ''deceptively frothy meringue of a monologue.'' Vreeland was an unconventional editor and an unconventional mother (though something of a traditional mate), and her slant on life was from an angle informed by beauty. She had, quite simply, an amazing eye. When I saw a screening of ''Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel,'' an entertaining new documentary that will have its premiere next Saturday during Fashion Week (it opens in limited release on Sept. 21 in New York and Los Angeles, and soon after in other cities), I was struck by how much Vreeland's voice pervades the film. Of course you see her pages from Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, which she took in 1963 and transformed into a beacon of pop culture. The film's producer and co-director, Lisa Immordino Vreeland, who is married to Vreeland's grandson, Alexander, also creates a vibrant backdrop for her subject's early years in Paris, London and New York.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn reviews several fashion documentaries set to open during New York Fashion Week, including Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel by Lisa Immordino Vreeland and Versailles by Deborah Riley Draper.
