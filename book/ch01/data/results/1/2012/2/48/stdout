There, large groups of models styled to the hilt in clothes from the house's numerous men's-wear collections milled around highly detailed vignettes or stages, which lent the looks perfect contexts. Bearded mountain men in distressed shearlings and bright plaid and American Indian-inspired flannels with jeans and khakis tucked into boots looked perfectly at home in a roughly hewn mountain cabin. Across the way, an ersatz university club housed nattily suited gents in soft-shouldered tweed sack suits, all from the Polo Ralph Lauren line. Past a glass and steel ski lodge with a million-dollar mountain view, we got a look at the new Black Label Denim collection, in its second season now. The denim- and leather-heavy line had two distinct vibes: one \u00e0 la \"The Aviator,\" with a coated cotton bomber jacket, sleek knits and double breasted coats in olive and brown. The other, very Brando in \"The Wild One,\" was heavy on the leather with moto-inspired ribbed knits, short zipped jackets and slim utility jeans. My favorite look from this bunch was a short belted black leather jacket with asymmetrical zippers and intricately padded shoulders, shown with a front pant and biker boots. Slick, chic and utterly wearable.","abstract":"The denim- and leather-heavy line had two distinct vibes: one \u00e0 la \"The Aviator,\" and the other, very Brando in \"The Wild One.\"","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"New York Top 5 | Ralph Lauren","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2012-02-09T17:32:38Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Bruce","rank":1,"lastname":"PASK"}],"original":"By BRUCE PASK"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a3058eb7c8105d8ebbb0","word_count":213},{"web_url":"http:\/\/offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com\/2012\/07\/26\/brewer-and-knicks-see-potential-in-each-other\/","snippet":"Ronnie Brewer has joined the Knicks because he, like the team, wants to win now.","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":"Ronnie Brewer has joined the Knicks because he, like the team, wants to win now.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Brewer and Knicks See Potential in Each Other","kicker":"Off the Dribble"},"keywords":[{"value":"New York Knicks","name":"organizations","rank":"1"},{"value":"Basketball","name":"subject","rank":"1"}],"pub_date":"2012-07-26T19:34:32Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Nate","lastname":"TAYLOR"}],"original":"By NATE TAYLOR"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"5011d4bc1c22dfde670b2a7b","word_count":611},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9901E2DB103FF93BA35752C0A9649D8B63","snippet":"The rapid rise of the hip-hop star Nicki Minaj.
