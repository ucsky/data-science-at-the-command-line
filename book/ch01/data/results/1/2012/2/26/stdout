Flooded with fashion editors, bloggers, celebrities and, of course, models, hotels will be celebrating with parties, panels, shopping and specialty drinks (care for a Kate Moss Cosmo?). Here are 10 places to rub shoulders with the tastemakers. THE EMPIRE HOTEL 44 West 63rd Street, (212) 265-7400; Empirehotelnyc.com. Not all the presentations (by K\u00fcning, Isa Tapia, Spanx), lounges and programs in this hotel across the street from Lincoln Center are closed to the public. During New York Fashion Week, the Empire will enable would-be models to get free makeovers inspired by the latest runway looks at the Allure Lounge Colored by Maybelline New York (updates @AllureLounge), Thursday through Sept. 13, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on the 63rd Street side of the Empire Hotel, off of the lobby. (Members of the news media and V.I.P.'s have their own lounge, Allure Upstairs). The public lounge will have live streams of fashion shows, free samples and refreshments. Maybelline makeup artists will offer touch-ups, the Ricardo Rojas Salon will give women \"high fashion\" ponytails, SkinMedica will offer skin consultations and Bioxidea will provide hand treatments. There will be iPads located throughout the lounge to allow guests to shop online with the hotel's partners. And at a fragrance bar, visitors who make a purchase from certain designers on Macys.com or Sephora.com will receive a gift.","abstract":"Description of nine trendy hotels around New York City celebrating Fashion Week with parties, panels, shopping and specialty drinks.
