Included are sly drawings by her husband, Ruben, who, she writes, fell hard for ''a shy dreamer of a girl.'' In a recent phone interview, Toledo said she has no events planned for New York Fashion Week, aside from launch for her own book on Thursday night at the W Times Square. ''It's just the impersonal feeling in fashion that exists now,'' she said, explaining why she sits out this twice-yearly industry event. ''It's just marketing.
