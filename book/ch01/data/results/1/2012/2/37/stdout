But the clothes, not the heads of storied houses, are typically what one expects to change from season to season. In 2011, a dozen big American and European brands ushered in new creative directors - including Olivier Rousteing, who took over at Balmain after Christophe Decarnin's sudden departure; Clare Waight Keller, who was at Pringle of Scotland before Chlo\u00e9, and Alistair Carr who stepped in to fill her shoes. In perhaps the most surprising move, Opening Ceremony's Humberto Leon and Carol Lim were asked to reinvigorate Kenzo. These designers, and 11 others, will be introducing closely watched debut or sophomore collections during the coming show season, which begins Thursday in New York and ends in Paris on March 7.
