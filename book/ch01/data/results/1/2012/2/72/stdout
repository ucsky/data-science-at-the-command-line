Along with a close friend from Gunnedah, the pastoral town where she grew up, Kerr set out to experience what for many is the draw of New Zealand: to escape and explore, to get a little lost and, in the process, get a little found. They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didn't know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted. ''Still, that backpacking trip, just having that freedom, was one of the best times in my life,'' Kerr recently reflected. ''Ever since, I've wanted to get back to New Zealand.''For seven months, beginning last December, Kerr, 29, got her wish. She spent the majority of her nonworking time in Wellington, New Zealand's capital, where her husband, Orlando Bloom, was filming ''The Hobbit,'' Peter Jackson's two-part prequel to the epic ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, the films that first made Bloom a star a decade ago. Wellington -- or ''Wellywood,'' as it's been christened since Jackson set up his studio empire in the suburb of Miramar -- is one of the most remote capitals on the planet: some 28 hours by plane from London, 23 from New York, 15 from Los Angeles, 14 hours from Hong Kong and Tokyo. Of the city's many charms -- its burgeoning restaurant scene, its absurdly picturesque scenery, the mellow Kiwi hospitality you experience everywhere you go -- it is Wellington's physical isolation that makes it such a singular place. During the week I spent in the city, no matter what I was doing, even something as simple as sitting at a cafe sipping a flat white (New Zealand's richer version of a latte), I felt a palpable remove from the ways and rhythms of the rest of the world. (Being on the other side of the international date line helps.) So while much of Wellington could be compared to, say, Portland, Ore., or Seattle, there is the added seduction of being pleasantly unmoored, able to take in the pleasure of civilization while existing outside of it.","abstract":"Model Miranda Kerr, who visited New Zealand at age 18, returns to the country to enjoy seven months of a simpler life reminiscent of her pre-fame days.
