Because this is a Quay Brothers movie, they also seem like automatons, something between men and machines. ''Later in life,'' Jakob (Mark Rylance) says, ''we shall all be something very small and subordinate.'' The Quays, masters of stop-motion animation, are the subjects of a gallery show at the Museum of Modern Art and a linked film series , which begins with what might seem like an anomaly in their canon, a live-action film, ''INSTITUTE BENJAMENTA, OR THIS DREAM PEOPLE CALL HUMAN LIFE.'' But this contained, cryptic, carefully composed black-and-white film is an instantly recognizable repository of Quay obsessions and themes. As is the institute, set in a forest in an unnamed Germanic place at a hard-to-pin-down time in the prewar past. Its walls crawl with shadows and prescriptive signs (''Perpetual motion compels morality''), and you might stumble upon the odd vitrine (one holds the powdered ejaculate of a stag and the legend, ''Please sniff''). ''Am I living in a fairy tale?'' Jakob wonders. He is: an ominous, dreamlike fairy tale for adults.
