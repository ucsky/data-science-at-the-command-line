I remember going into the Mark Cross store on Fifth Avenue with my parents. (This was in the late '60s.) There was an unfussy elegance to that store, just as there was to the main floor of Tiffany up the street, and it's not hard to picture guys in sack suits and skinny ties, maybe a rumpled khaki raincoat, going to check out the desk blotters. I was looking at the photo in The New Yorker this week that accompanies Robert A. Caro's article about Lyndon B. Johnson on the day of the Kennedy assassination -- it shows the president and a group of men, including reporters, leaving a Fort Worth hotel. Their uniformity (''Johnson hastily snatched off his hat,'' Mr. Caro noted), their desire for uniformity, is something that ''Mad Men'' fails to capture. But, of course, it is interested in entertainment, not in subtle differences of taste and body types.","abstract":"Revamped line of Mark Cross bags are available exclusively at Barneys.

But there is another, rarer side of fashion, when creative minds allow the art world and other influences to enter into their process. There is a rare opportunity to see this play out on the streets of New York. Here are four spectacular examples of people who dress with uncorralled abandon. For them, everything is possible. Many times it's the Eastern and African aesthetic of wrapping, folding or tying cloth on the body, not Western-style tailoring. 1.Louise Doktor, who works at a banking firm, wears a comforter coat, chosen for its color and fabric. 2. A skirt worn as a cape. 3. Two coats buttoned together for the colors, the extra sleeves tied over the shoulder. 4. A sequined curtain as a scarf. 5. On Fifth Avenue, the artist Timothy John wears a bathmat as a jacket, attracted by the nubbly texture. 6. An Indian carpet stitched on both ends and worn vertically one day and horizontally the next. 7. A wall hanging worn as a shawl. 8.Marjorie Stern, a fashion collector, is especially fond of fringe, as her scarves also show. 9. A group that included the fashion consultant Tziporah Salamon (at right). 10. In August, Ms. Salamon wore a lacy jacket and dropped-crotch trousers. Two others liked the lace jackets, too. 11. Tying together 99-cent scarves from the Salvation Army. 12 to 14. Mr. John's collection of jade worn as pendants. 15 and 16. Ms. Salamon's Bakelite bracelets.","abstract":"Fashion-forward people around New York City use art, textiles and other influences to create unconventional outfits.
