Back then, Botox sounded completely insane, if not lethal.

Later Sheryl Crow, who wrote the show's theme song, joins in the conversation. In ''The Jeff Probst Show,'' at 2 on NBC, Mr. Probst, the ''Survivor'' host, highlights the spirit of adventure. ''The Ricki Lake Show,'' at 4 on Channel 11, represents the return of Ms. Lake to this genre since leaving in 2004, with a focus on parenting, weight loss, beauty, career and relationships.

Mr. Duncan, who died last week at 54, received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his performance.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-09-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kathryn","lastname":"SHATTUCK"}],"original":"By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"505668741c22dfde670c8f23","word_count":736}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
