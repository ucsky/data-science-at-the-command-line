Last seen prominently on Miu Miu's spring 2010 runway -- be glad if you own one of those -- the feline popped up as an origami-like print on silk p.j. separates at Piamita; on flirty smock dresses in Victoria Beckham's new secondary line; and, at Fashion Week, on kitty-face sweaters worn by bloggers like Susie Bubble and Hanneli Mustaparta, courtesy of an Opening Ceremony collaboration with Glamour magazine. The most charming cat moment of the week, however, came on the Miguel Adrover runway. For his fall collection, the contrarian designer showed a sweater dress with stuffed knit cats mischievously crawling around it (above). Not for everyone, but seriously cute.
