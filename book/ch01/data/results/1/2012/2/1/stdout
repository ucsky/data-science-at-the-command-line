In the blacked-out setting for the Calvin Klein show on Thursday, the actresses Emma Stone (in red) and Rooney. Mara (in black) took their front-row places next to Emmanuelle Alt and Franca Sozzani, the editors respectively of French Vogue and Italian Vogue. Ms. Alt's usual game face for a show is either one of mild boredom or profound boredom. At Calvin, her expression was somewhere in between, and while most of the journalists in the room would have been eager to chat up Ms. Mara, Ms. Alt barely acknowledged her. Things got stranger when Eric Wilson, of The New York Times, tried to speak to Ms. Mara after the show about the Oscars (a lot of people are interested in what she will wear) and got a brushoff. One of the most sought-after actresses is sitting at a press event, surrounded by sophisticated editors and writers, and she pulls a Garbo. Priceless.","abstract":"It's easy to identify the best moment of Fashion Week.
