(13) DAS RHEINGOLD PBS is broadcasting Wagner's complete Ring cycle for the first time in more than two decades in a staging for the Metropolitan Opera by the Canadian director Robert Lepage that features a 45-ton set of 24 rotating planks nicknamed ''the machine.'' The story begins as the evil dwarf Alberich (Eric Owens) steals gold from the Rhine to forge a ring of unimaginable power. Bryn Terfel (above right, with Mr. Owens) sings the role of Wotan, the king of the gods, who uses magic to steal the ring, leading Alberich to put a curse on it, guaranteeing misery for its possessor. Wotan's refusal to part with the ring leads him to break a contract with the giants who have built the gods' new castle in the sky in exchange for Freia (Wendy Bryn Harmer), the goddess of love and the sister of Fricka, Wotan's wife (Stephanie Blythe). ''In many ways, even with all the high-tech elements, Mr. Lepage's production is fairly traditional,'' despite ''breathtaking stage tricks,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times, saying that he had ''mixed feelings'' about Mr. Lepage's work. Still, Mr. Tommasini added, he ''deserves credit for coaxing vivid portrayals from his cast.'' The three remaining operas in the cycle will be shown nightly through Friday. 6:35 A.M. (HBO Signature) TOM JONES (1963) Albert Finney (below, with Joyce Redman) stars as an 18th-century English foundling turned Casanova in Tony Richardson's Academy Award-winning adaptation of the classic novel by Henry Fielding. Susannah York is Sophie, the passionate daughter of the blue-blooded Squire Western (Hugh Griffith), and the woman Tom hopes to wed -- through her father has other plans. Writing in The Times, Bosley Crowther called the film ''surely one of the wildest, bawdiest and funniest comedies that a refreshingly agile filmmaker has ever brought to the screen.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-09-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kathryn","lastname":"SHATTUCK"}],"original":"By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"5057c3441c22dfde670c933f","word_count":791},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2012\/09\/17\/us\/ap-us-tv-abc-morning-subs.html","snippet":"Stephen Colbert and the cast of \"Modern Family\" are next up as \"Good Morning America\" guest hosts for Robin Roberts, who is scheduled to undergo a bone marrow transplant this week.","lead_paragraph":"Stephen Colbert and the cast of \"Modern Family\" are next up as \"Good Morning America\" guest hosts for Robin Roberts, who is scheduled to undergo a bone marrow transplant this week.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Colbert,' Modern Family' Cast to Guest Host 'GMA'"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-09-17T10:20:14Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"U.S.","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","person":[]},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"505733491c22dfde670c9135","word_count":690},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/01\/us\/politics\/house-votes-to-ease-restrictions-on-visas.html","snippet":"A measure that passed with mostly Republican support \u2014 many Democrats found it too narrow \u2014 previewed a fight over how far Congress should go in changing immigration laws.","lead_paragraph":"A measure that passed with mostly Republican support \u2014 many Democrats found it too narrow \u2014 previewed a fight over how far Congress should go in changing immigration laws.","abstract":null,"print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"seo":"House Votes to Ease Restrictions on Visas","main":"House Votes to Ease Visa Limits for Some Foreign Workers","print_headline":"House Votes To Ease Restrictions On Visas"},"keywords":[{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","value":"Hispanic-Americans","name":"subject"},{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","value":"United States Politics and Government","name":"subject"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"N","value":"Senate","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"7","is_major":"N","value":"House of Representatives","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"Visas","name":"subject"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","value":"Immigration and Emigration","name":"subject"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"Y","value":"Foreign Workers","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":"Politics","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"firstname":"Jeremy","middlename":"W.","lastname":"PETERS","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By JEREMY W.
