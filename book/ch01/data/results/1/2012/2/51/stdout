Like anyone born to achieve, he resented the small distractions -- and the fashion business provides plenty of them. Well, even he probably never dreamed that 661,509 people would go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to see his clothes. What were they expecting to see? Genius, yes; but the plain, early tailored pieces, like the bumster trousers and perfectly cut jackets, told a lot. The man knew what he was doing. Knowledge was his revolution. And whether or not he could see it, Mr. McQueen had built a durable brand. The Met show -- and the royal wedding dress designed by his successor, Sarah Burton -- was proof of that. 2 If you know anything about Ms. Burton (her skill, her objectivity, her patience), then it wasn't a surprise that Kate Middleton chose McQueen to make her gown as well as the streamlined dress worn by her sister, Pippa. Ms. Burton is a good listener, and she would have been sensitive to the bride and the overwhelming demands of the occasion. The dress distilled English tradition and needle crafts; its flawless fit and styling were communicated to a television audience of tens of millions, no small thing when the medium is cloth. So far, the Duchess of Cambridge has refused to allow herself to be pushed into the high-fashion trap. She wears clothes beautifully, from Reiss and Zara to McQueen, but the lady is no clothes horse. The last thing she wants to be, it seems, is another Jackie, Grace or Diana.","abstract":"Roundup of the top ten most memorable fashion moments of 2011.
