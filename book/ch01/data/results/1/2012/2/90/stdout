That book, her first for a mainstream audience, received a mostly dismissive review in our pages from the Rev. Raymond E. Brown, a biblical scholar and Catholic priest who concluded, in his last sentence, that the gnostics' chief adversary, ''crusty old Irenaeus,'' had been ''right, after all, to regard the gnostics as the crazies of the second century.'' But Pagels's analysis of the early church struck a nerve, and not just at the time. As Laura Miller noted recently in Salon, a ''badly garbled version'' turned up in ''The Da Vinci Code'' in 2003 and ''proceeded to blow the minds of many readers.'' Coincidentally (or not), 2003 is also the year Pagels scored her first New York Times best seller, ''Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas.'' Her next book, a study of Judas written with the Harvard professor Karen King, also landed here, in 2007, and now Pagels is back. Her latest effort, ''Revelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation,'' enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 10. Reviewing the book in The New Yorker this month, Adam Gopnik highlighted Pagels's argument that Revelation is ''essentially an anti-Christian polemic . . . written by an expatriate follower of Jesus who wanted the movement to remain within an entirely Jewish context, as opposed to the 'Christianity' just then being invented.'' Gopnik continued: ''The scarlet whores and mad beasts in Revelation are the Gentile followers of Paul -- and so, in a neat irony, the spiritual ancestors of today's Protestant evangelicals.'' BUG SHACK: A couple of years after Mike Harvey bought a small Volkswagen repair shop in Kennewick, Wash., in 2006, people started dropping in with cameras and hand-drawn maps. ''They would look around and say to each other, 'I think this is the place,' '' Harvey said in a recent phone interview. ''Then they would ask if they could take a picture.'' It turns out that a version of the garage, which Harvey named the Bug Shack, features prominently in the urban fantasy novels of Patricia Briggs, in which the shape-shifting heroine, Mercy Thompson, holds down a day job as a VW mechanic while rubbing haunches with werewolves and vampires by night. (The latest entry, ''Fair Game,'' hits the hardcover list this week at No. 4.) Harvey hasn't read the books himself -- ''I opened a second auto shop in October,'' he said; ''I don't have a lot of time to read'' -- but one of his mechanics is married to a fan, and Harvey hopes to catch up with the series someday. ''I've had the opportunity to meet the author a couple of times, and she's given us signed books,'' he said. ''Honestly, this sounds like exactly the kind of escapist story I'd appreciate.'' He may get a chance soon: the Bug Shack is up for sale. ''I couldn't just close it down,'' he said. ''This place has been serving VW customers for 30 years, and now it's, like, a piece of literary history.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2012\/03\/16\/books\/insidecap\/insidecap-thumbStandard-v2.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2012\/03\/16\/books\/insidecap\/insidecap-thumbStandard-v2.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Inside the List","kicker":"TBR"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}],"pub_date":"2012-03-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Gregory","lastname":"COWLES"}],"original":"By GREGORY COWLES"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2ae258eb7c8105d89c46d","word_count":623},{"web_url":"http:\/\/learning.blogs.nytimes.com\/2012\/07\/30\/student-contest-winner-from-one-scout-to-another-remove-the-ban-on-gays\/","snippet":"This week's winner is a Girl Scout who discusses the Boy Scouts' antigay policies.","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":"This week's winner is a Girl Scout who discusses the Boy Scouts' antigay policies.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Student Contest Winner | From One Scout to Another, Remove the Ban on Gays","kicker":"The Learning Network"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-07-30T14:32:19Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ben","lastname":"MURRAY"}],"original":"By BEN MURRAY"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"5016d4f81c22dfde670b332a","word_count":663},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9B02E0DC1130F93AA25757C0A9649D8B63","snippet":"International     INDIAN STATE FINDS ITSELF  ","lead_paragraph":"International INDIAN STATE FINDS ITSELF","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Inside The Times"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-04-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Summary","_id":"4fd100ea8eb7c8105d5bbf18","word_count":656},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9F00E7DB103AF930A1575BC0A9649D8B63","snippet":"InternationalCHOLERA EPIDEMIC SWEEPS","lead_paragraph":"InternationalCHOLERA EPIDEMIC SWEEPS","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Inside the Times"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-08-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Summary","_id":"503e88c61c22dfde670b7cc7","word_count":590},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2012\/08\/30\/arts\/30reuters-monroe.html","snippet":"A U.S. appeals court has upheld the right of a Marilyn Monroe photo library to license images of the film star taken by a celebrity photographer who was one of her business partners.","lead_paragraph":"A U.S. appeals court has upheld the right of a Marilyn Monroe photo library to license images of the film star taken by a celebrity photographer who was one of her business partners.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photo Library Can License Marilyn Monroe Images, Court Rules"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-08-30T17:15:31Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"REUTERS","original":"By REUTERS","person":[]},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"507c343a95e998af711830ee","word_count":490},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9401E2D9103FF930A35757C0A9649D8B63","snippet":"8 P.M.

Or, if you're a contestant on this show, to receive a free new wardrobe. The six remaining contestants get clothes to fit their slimmer waistlines when the fashion professional Jeannie Mai and the stylist Ken Paves join the show in this makeover episode. All dressed up, the contestants just need somewhere to go. That problem is solved when they receive an invitation to visit the White House and meet with the first lady, Michelle Obama. The contestants travel to Washington, where they reunite with their families and show the payoff from their hard work. In the second part of the episode, appearing next week, Mrs. Obama works out with them and discusses the benefits of an active lifestyle. Above, a scene from the show. 10:15 A.M. (Showtime 2) OUTSOURCED (2007) After Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton) loses his job as a call-center manager, he is sent to India to train his replacement in this film from John Jeffcoat. Todd is initially grumpy about the change in his fortunes and has trouble adjusting to the food, the crowds and the language. But then he falls for one of his colleagues at work, the bright and self-possessed Asha (Ayesha Dharker), and he learns to embrace India and recognize the benefits of change. Reviewing this movie for The New York Times, Matt Zoller Seitz called it ''a wonderful surprise'' and said ''the filmmakers treat Todd's story as a springboard for a smart look at the effect of cultural difference on work, friendship and love, and the global economy's impact on national and personal identity.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-04-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Thomas","lastname":"GAFFNEY"}],"original":"By THOMAS GAFFNEY"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"4fd100a08eb7c8105d5bb66f","word_count":739},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/03\/30\/arts\/design\/artists-in-dialogue-at-the-kitchen.html","snippet":"At the Kitchen, a nonprofit space in Chelsea, dialogue between artists and their community is encouraged.","lead_paragraph":"At the Kitchen, a nonprofit space in Chelsea, dialogue between artists and their community is encouraged.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Artists in Dialogue at the Kitchen","kicker":"Weekend Miser"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"2012-03-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts \/ Art & Design","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Rachel","middlename":"Lee","lastname":"HARRIS","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By RACHEL LEE HARRIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2ae268eb7c8105d89c569","word_count":604},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/16\/nyregion\/how-bronson-van-wyck-event-planner-spends-sundays.html","snippet":"Bronson van Wyck, who plans parties, usually exercises on Sunday mornings, then visits Forbidden Planet and the Strand.","lead_paragraph":"Bronson van Wyck, who plans parties, usually exercises on Sunday mornings, then visits Forbidden Planet and the Strand.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2012\/12\/16\/nyregion\/16ROUTINE2_SPAN\/16ROUTINE2_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","height":360,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2012\/12\/16\/nyregion\/16ROUTINE2_SPAN\/16ROUTINE2_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"360"},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"thumbnail","url":"images\/2012\/12\/16\/nyregion\/16ROUTINE2_SPAN\/16ROUTINE2_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"width":75,"legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2012\/12\/16\/nyregion\/16ROUTINE2_SPAN\/16ROUTINE2_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"How Bronson van Wyck, Event Planner, Spends Sundays","main":"If It\u2019s Not a Party, It\u2019s a Workout","kicker":"Sunday Routine | Bronson Van Wyck","print_headline":"If It\u2019s Not a Party, It\u2019s a Workout"},"keywords":[{"value":"Van Wyck, Bronson","is_major":"Y","rank":"1","name":"persons"},{"value":"Madison Square Park (NYC)","is_major":"N","rank":"3","name":"glocations"},{"value":"Parties (Social)","is_major":"Y","rank":"2","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2012-12-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metro","section_name":"N.Y. \/ Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"John","lastname":"LELAND"}],"original":"By JOHN LELAND"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"50cbfe6100315214fbb7f823","word_count":"709"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/05\/24\/garden\/makeshift-workshop-to-rehabilitate-chairs.html","snippet":"Castoffs from the sidewalk and online are rescued, restored to life and then returned to the streets.","lead_paragraph":"Castoffs from the sidewalk and online are rescued, restored to life and then returned to the streets.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2012\/05\/24\/garden\/24MAKE_SPAN\/24MAKE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","height":380,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2012\/05\/24\/garden\/24MAKE_SPAN\/24MAKE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"380"},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"thumbnail","url":"images\/2012\/05\/24\/garden\/24MAKE_SPAN\/24MAKE_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"width":75,"legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2012\/05\/24\/garden\/24MAKE_SPAN\/24MAKE_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"MakeShift Workshop to Rehabilitate Chair Castoffs at Partners &amp;
