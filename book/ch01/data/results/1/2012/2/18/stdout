How could a pair of self-professed mall kids from suburban Los Angeles have figured out the key to fashion for their generation? No matter where you shop today, you can detect their influence. The reverence for 1980s California streetwear brands, the discovery of indie labels from far-flung corners of the world, the fervor for unconventional collaborations, the unapologetic embrace of hipsters, even the success of the fast-fashion Topshop chain in the United States -- it can all be traced to the store Ms. Lim and Mr. Leon opened in 2002.","abstract":"Opening Ceremony, probably the most influential retailer of the new millennium, prepares for New York Fashion Week.
