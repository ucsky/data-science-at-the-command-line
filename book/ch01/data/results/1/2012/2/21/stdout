His fingerprints can be found on the graphic design of logos and packaging for some of the coolest designers of the new generation, with lettering, treatments and fonts that are carefully chosen to suggest a specific mood or emotion. When you look at a black gift box from Alexander Wang, you might think, ''Hmm, kind of graphic, industrial.'' Or you might see a street poster for Jason Wu, with the designer's name in neon hairline script, and say, ''How elegant, but also youthful.'' Or you could receive an invitation from Rodarte that was dipped in black wax or covered in sand and think, ''How endearingly kooky.''","abstract":"Description of several stylists whose work on the runways will shape the look of this year's New York Fashion Week.

But given the direction of his career over the last decade, his image is now more like that of an empire builder. Among the up-andcoming labels he has helped develop are Alice + Olivia, Rag & Bone, Helmut Lang and, most recently, Proenza Schouler. His conglomeratebuilding has been described as the American equivalent of Gucci or LVMH -- and by Anna Wintour, no less.","abstract":"Fashion company heads Andrew Rosen, Bernard Arnault, Carmen Busquets and Mickey Drexler will represent the business side of the industry during New York Fashion Week.

In the blacked-out setting for the Calvin Klein show on Thursday, the actresses Emma Stone (in red) and Rooney Mara (in black) took their front-row places next to Emmanuelle Alt and Franca Sozzani, the editors respectively of French Vogue and Italian Vogue. Ms. Alt's usual game face for a show is either one of mild boredom or profound boredom. At Calvin, her expression was somewhere in between, and while most of the journalists in the room would have been eager to chat up Ms. Mara, Ms. Alt barely acknowledged her. Things got stranger when Eric Wilson, of The New York Times, tried to speak to Ms. Mara about the Oscars (a lot of people are interested in what she will wear) and got a brushoff. A sought-after actress is sitting at a press event, surrounded by sophisticated editors and writers, and she pulls a Garbo. Priceless.","abstract":"Cathy Horyn describes her favorite stand-out designer collections and looks from New York Fashion Week.

As the spring 2013 runway season begins today, there is a sense that everyone will be trying just a little harder, that the fashion flock came home from their vacations a little earlier, especially in Europe. The game is on, and the star players are taking their places. In New York, there are young designers on the rise, each vying to become the next big thing. In Paris, the first ready-towear shows of Raf Simons at Dior and Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent will take place, showcasing two of the most important designers in fashion today. Which will be the definitive look of the season? The lush coloring of Mr. Simons at Dior? Or the as-yet-undefined vision of Mr. Slimane for Saint Laurent. But the truth is, there is already a talented field of designers at work, most of whom have only recently risen to the level of establishment. There are, of course, perennials (Ralph, Giorgio, Karl, Donatella -- if they don't need a last name, they're here to stay), but you have the feeling that a leadership change had been in order for some time. Here are the designers who are ruling the game today. RAF SIMONS","abstract":"Description of some of the talented and established designers who will dominate New York Fashion Week.
