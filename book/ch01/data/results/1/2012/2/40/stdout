In June, she danced the night away at her 95th-birthday party at the Gramercy Park Hotel. Last month she was photographed at the reopening of the XL club, surrounded by people a third her age. And only Wednesday she took her customary front-row seat at the fashion show of her friend, the designer Joanna Mastroianni, at Lincoln Center, part of New York Fashion Week.","abstract":"Zelda Kaplan, an inimitable fixture on fashion's front lines and an inveterate clubgoer in Manhattan, dies at age 95.

Hosted by John Demsey, the president of Este\u00e9 Lauder Cosmetics, and M.A.C., the intimate affair in the Waverly's fire-warmed back room was billed proudly as an opportunity for Gill and Adams to thank and honor the many stylish women who have inspired and supported their label over the years. Among those in attendance were Paper Magazine's Kim Hastreiter, the T contributor Lynn Yaeger, Cecilia Dean and Michelle Harper. The odd man out - and a delightful surprise to see at the room's elegant, ranunculus-full tables - was Antony Hegarty, the lead singer for Antony and the Johnsons. Calm and gracious (with less than two weeks before their fall 2012 runway showon Monday, Feb. 12 at Milk Studios), Gill and Adams gave guests an evening as refreshing and hip as their recent collections. \"Now, it's just about the details,\" said Gill about what's left to do before Fashion Week starts.

Those sweatshirts, printed with cartoonish slogans and images (left), have not yet hit stores, but a couple of scaled-back variations have trickled into the Chelsea shop. Happily, with high fashion once again appropriating the mundane sweatshirt, there are plenty of cool options. In his prefall collection for Jil Sander, Raf Simons showed a preppy JS logo sweatshirt. At Kenzo, Carol Lim and Humberto Leon reprised the Kenzo tiger on a bright logo style. And there are others, from A.P.C., from Alexander Wang. For a pulled-together look, wear with a pencil skirt or leather pants; or layer over a button-down and a great new pair of wide-leg trousers.

During Fashion Week, particularly in New York, it has become a common complaint that there are too many shows, something like 300 scheduled within eight days, and that a lot of designers get lost as a result. The new idea, which is being pitched as an alternative to runway or presentation formats, is that rather than slogging across town or making some excuse about being on deadline, an editor or buyer can watch the collection on a computer or mobile device.","abstract":"KCD, the public relations company that produces fashion shows for top labels like Marc Jacobs and Givenchy, announced on Monday that it is offering a new service wherein it will produce some shows in an entirely digital format so that overtaxed editors can watch them online.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Now, Online-Only Fashion Shows for Busy Editors","kicker":"On the Runway"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2012-01-23T10:34:01Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Eric","rank":1,"lastname":"WILSON"}],"original":"By ERIC WILSON"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a23b8eb7c8105d8e9f05","word_count":477},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/07\/19\/fashion\/home-shopping-for-baby-boomers.html","snippet":"Diane Gilman has sold five million pairs of jeans and leggings on HSN, the bulk in the last few years.
