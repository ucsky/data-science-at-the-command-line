(Sho2) THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) Colin Firth, left, in an Oscar-winning role, portrays Albert Frederick Arthur George, or Bertie, as his family called him, the shy second son of George V of Britain (Michael Gambon) in this film from Tom Hooper. Geoffrey Rush is Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who helps him conquer his debilitating stutter. And Helena Bonham Carter is Elizabeth, Bertie's wife and staunch support system, who can't quite stomach Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), the American divorc\u00e9e who derails Bertie's older brother, David (Guy Pearce), from his position as Edward VIII. ''It isn't exactly 'Pygmalion,' not least because Mr. Hooper has no intention of satirizing the caste system that is one of this movie's biggest draws,'' Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, said of the film, which earned Mr. Hooper an Oscar as best director. ''Each character has his moments, instances when Bertie the closed book tentatively opens and Logue's arrogance gets away from him, but both are too decent, too banal and the film too ingratiating to resonate deeply.'' In the end, she added, ''like many entertainments of this pop-historical type, 'The King's Speech' wears history lightly no matter how heavy the crown.'' The film also received Academy Awards for best picture and original screenplay (David Seidler). 8 P.M. (ABC) THE BACHELOR Ben Flajnik, a 29-year-old winemaker from Sonoma, Calif., takes the 18 remaining bachelorettes on an exploration of his hometown vineyards. Two of the women receive one-on-one dates with Mr. Flajnik, while the others must show him another side of their personalities in auditions for a community-theater production written by children.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-01-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kathryn","lastname":"SHATTUCK"}],"original":"By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"4fd2997d8eb7c8105d877119","word_count":747},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/06\/11\/world\/middleeast\/syrian-conflict-cracks-carefully-polished-image-of-assad.html","snippet":"With help from high-priced advisers, President Bashar al-Assad and his wife tried to portray themselves as progressive, and even glamorous, in the Western news media.","lead_paragraph":"With help from high-priced advisers, President Bashar al-Assad and his wife tried to portray themselves as progressive, and even glamorous, in the Western news media.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2012\/06\/11\/world\/11assad_cnd\/11assad_cnd-articleLarge.jpg","height":330,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2012\/06\/11\/world\/11assad_cnd\/11assad_cnd-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"330"},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"thumbnail","url":"images\/2012\/06\/11\/world\/11assad_cnd\/11assad_cnd-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"width":75,"legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2012\/06\/11\/world\/11assad_cnd\/11assad_cnd-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"Syrian Conflict Cracks Carefully Polished Image of Assad","main":"Syria\u2019s Assads Turned to West for Glossy P.R.","print_headline":"Syria\u2019s Assads Turned to West For Glossy P.R."},"keywords":[{"value":"Public Relations and Publicity","is_major":"N","rank":"5","name":"subject"},{"value":"Brown Lloyd James","is_major":"N","rank":"9","name":"organizations"},{"value":"Walters, Barbara","is_major":"N","rank":"7","name":"persons"},{"value":"Middle East and North Africa Unrest (2010- )","is_major":"N","rank":"6","name":"subject"},{"value":"Assad, Bashar al-","is_major":"Y","rank":"3","name":"persons"},{"value":"Vogue","is_major":"N","rank":"8","name":"organizations"},{"value":"Bell Pottinger Group","is_major":"N","rank":"10","name":"organizations"},{"value":"Syria","is_major":"Y","rank":"1","name":"glocations"},{"value":"Assad, Asma al-","is_major":"N","rank":"2","name":"persons"},{"value":"News and News Media","is_major":"N","rank":"4","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2012-06-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bill","lastname":"CARTER"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2,"firstname":"Amy","lastname":"CHOZICK"}],"original":"By BILL CARTER and AMY CHOZICK"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"515b526cfdc59278db00816f","word_count":"1439"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/09\/20\/fashion\/djs-who-spin-the-family-name.html","snippet":"Children of the rich and famous find work and news media attention at the turntable.","lead_paragraph":"Children of the rich and famous find work and news media attention at the turntable.","abstract":"Alexandra Richards, daughter of the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, is one of the many children of celebrities to become a disc jockey;
