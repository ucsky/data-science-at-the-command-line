As the New York spring collections unfolded this week, simple styles by two European designers, Azzedine Ala\u00efa and the label Alexander McQueen, designed by Sarah Burton, popped up consistently on the avenues. Ala\u00efa's princess dress, left and right, was designed with sophisticated knitting technology. From a molded bodice, the skirt is released into a graceful circle that moves with the body. At far left are black and beige sheaths from McQueen. The prototype, far left, top, which was shown on the Paris runway in the spring, had a lace-like black cage of leather over a beige knit sheath with a flanged hem. The commercial version, not seen at the press shows, represents practical reality: it is completely of knit fabric and has lost the flanged hem. The popularity of the dresses may indicate that women are moving away from separates. What they appear to want is a flattering look that they can zip themselves into in 30 seconds.","abstract":"Bill Cunningham captures women in New York City wearing figure-flattering one-piece dresses during New York Fashion Week.

But the clothes, not the heads of storied houses, are typically what one expects to change from season to season. In 2011, a dozen big American and European brands ushered in new creative directors -- including Olivier Rousteing, who took over at Balmain after Christophe Decarnin's sudden departure; Clare Waight Keller, who was at Pringle of Scotland before Chlo\u00e9; and Alistair Carr who stepped in to fill her shoes. In perhaps the most surprising move, Opening Ceremony's Humberto Leon and Carol Lim were asked to reinvigorate Kenzo.","abstract":"Roundup of a dozen fashion brands with new creative directors who will be introducing closely watched debut or sophomore collections during the coming runway show season.

''My personal style is almost tomboy. It was a very funny paradox.'' From her modest studio in the Marais, Ms. Haynes, 31, remembers this contradiction as the inspiration for her label, called Calla, which, after five seasons in Paris, she is presenting for the first time at New York Fashion Week on Saturday. The move to New York will not only make her boyfriend jacket and robe gaine (gaine is French girdle -- think of the world's tiniest bustier dress) more accessible to the American market, but will avoid the high costs of showing in Paris, which for many young designers can be prohibitive.","abstract":"Designer Calla Haynes will present her French clothing Calla at New York Fashion Week; notes that it is much cheaper to put on a runway show in New York than in Paris.
