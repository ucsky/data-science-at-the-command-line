This season, children were seen alongside runways across the city during Fashion Week. Little ones clutched their parents' hands as they made their way through the crowds into shows like Prabal Gurung, Derek Lam and Tommy Hilfiger. Some had insider access as the children of designers, while others took their places in the front row next to their well-connected parents. Perhaps this early exposure will sway their career choices, or maybe it will just influence their style aesthetic. Watch out, Tavi Gevinson.

Most of SoHo and the meatpacking district looked like a police state for fashion victims. All in all, Fashion's Night Out, now in its fourth year, looked much the same as in years past, with the exception, perhaps, that the big crowds stayed mostly downtown. The Calvin Klein store at 654 Madison Avenue, where Dwyane Wade was signing autographs, was hopping, but north of that looked pretty ordinary, though others would probably disagree.","abstract":"Eric Wilson discusses the scene in New York City during the Fashion's Night Out shopping event; notes that big crowds stayed mostly downtown this year.
