To channel Ervell's vision of contrasts, the hairstylist Holli Smith played with juxtaposing textures and lots of different sprays: \"There's a frizzy, dry feel on top, with strokes of shine below, right around the edges.\" After amplifying volume with Oribe Maximista Thickening Hair Spray, Smith spritzed Oribe Soft Lacquer Hair Spray to the top of the head, and went in with a curling iron. The newly-created waves were then dulled down with the help of Oribe Dry Texturizing Hair Spray. To keep the bottom and sides looking glossy, Smith layered on generous amounts of Oribe Superfine Strong Hair Spray. Continuing the theme of opposites, the makeup artist Maki Ryoke said, \"I'm keeping the T-zone very matte, but highlighting the cheekbones for an almost 3-D effect.\" Skin was cleaned with Bioderma Crealine, then lightly moisturized with Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream, both of which are fashion-world cult favorites. Ryoke proceeded by correcting complexions with Bobbi Brown concealers and hydrating lips with Australian Lucas' Papaw Ointment. Final steps included muting mouths with a thin veil of concealer \"to make the whole face appear more uniform\" and patting more Embryolisse high on the cheeks, for a quiet, subtle glow.","abstract":"\"My starting point was a police aesthetic, so the clothes were a bit uniform-y, uptight and strict,\" the designer shared backstage.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Backstage Grooming Report | Patrik Ervell","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"4","name":"subject","value":"Fashion and Apparel"},{"rank":"3","name":"subject","value":"Cosmetics and Toiletries"},{"rank":"2","name":"persons","value":"Ervell, Patrik"},{"rank":"5","name":"subject","value":"New York Fashion Week"},{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2012-02-13T18:03:40Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Katie","rank":1,"lastname":"CHANG"}],"original":"By KATIE CHANG"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a31f8eb7c8105d8ebf5d","word_count":246},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/02\/09\/fashion\/pierre-rougier-the-man-who-says-no.html","snippet":"Pierre Rougier, who has a client list that includes Jil Sander, L\u2019Wren Scott and Versace, is one of that world\u2019s most influential \u2014 and controversial \u2014 characters.","lead_paragraph":"Pierre Rougier, who has a client list that includes Jil Sander, L\u2019Wren Scott and Versace, is one of that world\u2019s most influential \u2014 and controversial \u2014 characters.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2012\/02\/09\/fashion\/09ROUGIER_SPAN\/09zROUGIER-articleLarge.jpg","height":380,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2012\/02\/09\/fashion\/09ROUGIER_SPAN\/09zROUGIER-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"380"},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"thumbnail","url":"images\/2012\/02\/09\/fashion\/09ROUGIER_SPAN\/09zROUGIER-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"width":75,"legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2012\/02\/09\/fashion\/09ROUGIER_SPAN\/09zROUGIER-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"Pierre Rougier, the Man With the Power to Say No","main":"The Man Who Says No","print_headline":"The Man With the Power to Say No"},"keywords":[{"value":"Scott, L'Wren","is_major":"N","rank":"5","name":"persons"},{"value":"Public Relations and Publicity","is_major":"Y","rank":"3","name":"subject"},{"value":"Rodriguez, Narciso","is_major":"N","rank":"6","name":"persons"},{"value":"New York Fashion Week","is_major":"N","rank":"1","name":"subject"},{"value":"Fashion and Apparel","is_major":"Y","rank":"2","name":"subject"},{"value":"Rougier, Pierre","is_major":"Y","rank":"4","name":"persons"}],"pub_date":"2012-02-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Styles","section_name":"Fashion & Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By LAURA M.
