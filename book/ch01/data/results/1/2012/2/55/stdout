And it turns out that it was. Mr. Hallberg is injured, and Mr. Bokaer's ''Curtain,'' a collaboration with the visual artist Daniel Arsham, will take a different shape at its Pillow premiere on Wednesday. It's no less worth seeing, though. Mr. Bokaer's latest works have been striking for both their originality and their aesthetic impact, and the collaboration with Mr. Arsham promises a dramatic visual setting, with cast fiberglass molds that will melt during the performance, offering changing shapes as a living sculptural counterpoint to the dance. For the last-minute changes to the work obliged by Mr. Hallberg's injury, Mr. Bokaer has turned to Adam Weinert and James McGinn, dancers who have worked with him frequently, using them in the work's second half, ''Les Innocents,'' while performing alone in the opening section. 8:15 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday, Doris Duke Theater, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745, jacobspillow.org; $35 to 38.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"July 29 -- Aug. 4","kicker":"THE WEEK AHEAD"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-07-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"50136a761c22dfde670b2dea","word_count":1416},{"web_url":"http:\/\/mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com\/2012\/09\/27\/times-selects-deborah-needleman-to-run-its-style-magazines\/","snippet":"Ms. Needleman comes from The Wall Street Journal, where she oversaw WSJ. magazine and the weekend lifestyle section, called Off Duty.
