Many of the top models working today, like Lara Stone, Joan Smalls and Arizona Muse, reflect a changing aesthetic toward healthier figures and at least some representation of diversity in race and age. And yet, season after season, we still see models who appear to be dangerously thin or, here at the beginning of another New York Fashion Week, models who are as young as 14, even though designers and modeling agencies have pledged not to cast girls younger than 16 in the shows.

At the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the pergolas of Japanese wisteria, some 30 inches in length, range from deep mauve to nearly white. On some, the tiny blossoms look like roses; others have the more typical pod shape. There are four topiaries around the Worth Monument near Madison Square Park. Wisteria also can be found at Rockefeller Center and a community garden on the West Side. The cascading blossoms remind me of what I saw in Paris last month: the elongated look of women in stripes.","abstract":"Bill Cunningham photo spread compares spring blossoms found in and around New York City to looks seen at Paris Fashion Week.
