All over the city, women have been tearing sleeves off coats and jackets to look more casual -- it's almost like buying a bike without fenders. They should be thankful for the unusually mild weather. In sharp contrast, the designer collections seen last week put architecture back into cloth coats. Among the more memorable: the Edwardian style from Donna Karan, photos Nos. 5 and 10. Ralph Lauren's dandies, No. 11, and his British tweeds, Nos. 12 to 15, hit the perfect fashion notes in this dramatic turn to clothes that sharpen the wearer's image. Perhaps the most innovative tailoring was from Narciso Rodriguez, Nos. 16 to 18. By displacing the common-seeming, he added a totally new volume. From Rodarte, a house specializing in dresses, buttoned-up coats, Nos. 1 to 3, were a highlight. At Tommy Hilfiger, Nos. 4 and 9, coats featured a military precision. From Marc Jacobs, No. 6, there were jackets with a late Victorian shape. From Michael Kors, No. 7, a greatcoat had an asymmetric fur collar. And from Thakoon, No. 8, we saw the nonchalance of the '40s haberdasher style.","abstract":"Highlights of the most memorable tailored coats featured on the runways during New York Fashion Week.

In the ultimate test of designer devotion, Ms. Love nixed her usual presentation to host a pop-up tattoo parlor at Milk\/Made's Digital Bar this weekend. ''I wanted a break from showing, while still being involved in Fashion Week somehow,'' said the ink-happy designer, who has 16 tattoos of her own. ''Tattoos are the ultimate and most permanent form of adornment, and I love that about it.'' Two of Ms. Love's best friends, Minka Sicklinger, right, and Patrick King, known as Fish, are handling the tattoo guns. Sessions are by appointment only, with a selection of designs illustrated by her husband, Matthew Jameson Nelson Love, and inspired by the same motifs that made her classic collection a hit: arrowheads, skulls, dream catchers and moon phases. ''I figure either it will work -- rad people will come and get cool tattoos -- or people won't be that interested in it, and me and my friends will just get tattooed over and over for two days straight,'' she said.

Indeed, as the industry extends its arms (and offers, no doubt, of co-branding), there's a strong impulse to yell, ''Run, Lena, run!'' In a fashion smackdown with ''Sex and the City,'' ''Girls'' would clearly lose. But the New York of ''Sex and the City'' scarcely exists today. It has vacated to Brooklyn, which is Ms. Dunham's turf. The values have changed. Ms. Dunham's liberal feminist voice is dry with humor and failure. And those are concepts that the resolutely perky, mendacious fashion world just can't cope with; in its view, women must still be talon-sharp. Ms. Dunham's character on ''Girls'' seems to ask the question, ''You don't think I'm pretty?'' Yet our faith in her lies in the fact that she will not give quarter to your stupid judgments. For fashion, that's an interesting dialogue to have.","abstract":"Lena Dunham and rapper ASAP Rocky, who are known as outside tastemakers, may make a splash during New York Fashion Week.
