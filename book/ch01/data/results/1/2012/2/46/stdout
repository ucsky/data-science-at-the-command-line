''We just sort of boomeranged,'' Ms. Parker-Barker, 25, said brightly of the last few years. She thought, as many fashion graduates did, that she would be living in New York, working for a big-name designer and eating pizza at Roberta's. But the recession, as well as a rekindled romance with Cameron and a return to Utah, changed that. Ms. Parker-Barker isn't complaining, though.","abstract":"Fashion designer Hayley Parker-Barker introduces boys' clothing line Culdesac, which features non-graphic, timeless T-shirts.
