I have been photographing several of them for decades, but they don't necessarily know one another. Last week, free-spirited dressers created an amazing sight at 8:45 a.m. while on their way to work: top right, from left, Marjorie Stern, Timothy John, Andrew Mukamal, Tziporah Salamon and David Don D Sealey. Ms. Stern is a grandmother and a retailer; her signature is multiple scarves and necklaces. Mr. John, an artist, has this philosophy: ''I refuse to be defined by other people's limitations.'' He wears clothes upside down and inside out, often demonstrating on the spot. Mr. Mukamal, 24, who works in fashion media, is the Beau Brummell of the future, mixing avant-garde designers with bravado. Ms. Salamon bikes to work in antique Asian and Matisse-inspired textiles. Mr. Sealey, in his 20s, dresses in hip-hop style and creates jewelry. Delroy Smith, right, drawn in by the spectacle, stopped in his tracks; he works in fashion and makes his own clothes.","abstract":"Bill Cunningham photos of some free-spirited dressers in New York City on their way to work.
