Dover Street Market, named for its location in London's tony Mayfair neighborhood, is a mash-up of market, department store and museum. Individual concessions handpicked by Kawakubo, which run the gamut from luxury labels like Lanvin and Azzedine Ala\u00efa to the utilitarian wares of Labour & Wait and the edible goods of Rose Bakery, share space with art and design installations and the multiple labels in the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons fashion family. Last week, Kawakubo opened Dover Street Market in Tokyo, doubling its size and placing it squarely in the center of Ginza, the city's shopping mecca, where venerable department stores, luxury boutiques and the supersize flagship stores of brands like Uniqlo line the streets. Adrian Joffe, Kawakubo's husband and business partner, says that he and Kawakubo were offered the space in the old Ginza Komatsu department store and that \"we were excited by the challenge of setting up shop in the conservative traditional Ginza area.\"","abstract":"Rei Kawakubo's London mash-up of market, department store and museum comes to Japan.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Even Bigger in Japan | Tokyo Gets Its Own Dover Street Market","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2012-03-23T16:30:47Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Brooke","rank":1,"lastname":"HODGE"}],"original":"By BROOKE HODGE"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a39d8eb7c8105d8ed348","word_count":444}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
