Which I understand, but where's the room for creativity?\" A full interview with the designer is after the jump.","abstract":"Isabel Toledo on her new book, and why she avoids New York Fashion Week.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Good Yarn","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2012-02-16T16:05:36Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"T:Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stephen","rank":1,"lastname":"HEYMAN"}],"original":"By STEPHEN HEYMAN"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd3a3768eb7c8105d8ecbc7","word_count":955},{"web_url":"http:\/\/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com\/2012\/06\/29\/chic-in-review-make-that-hedi-slimane-for-ysla\/","snippet":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":"All the fashion news of the week that's fit to reprint.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chic in Review | Make That Hedi Slimane for YSLA?

''A bun and a thing,'' Mr. Mau said, referring to the stylish knot of hair perched high on his scalp and the smaller tuft gathered near his collar. If it's not the coiffure you associate with the ancient vocation of woodworking, you clearly did not spend time at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair, which on Tuesday ended its annual four-day run at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Mr. Mau, 25, designer and production manager of Studio Dunn, a two-year-old furniture company in Providence, R.I., was part of an army of youthful exhibitors who were rocking on the heels of their pointy-toed leather shoes or fuzzy polka-dot sneakers as they introduced updated versions of such hoary designs as Shaker chairs and gentlemen's valets.","abstract":"Craft and handmade furniture appear to be latest trend at New York's 2012 International Contemporary Furniture Fair, overshadowing the once-dominant mid-century modernist style; city-supported initiative Design Week NYC, set to begin in 2013, will enlarge the scope of the annual New York design festival, event that coincides each year with the International Contemporary Furniture Fair.

Miller died on Tuesday, December 20 of cirrhosis of the liver at Stony Brook Medical Center after a five-week hospitalization. She was 78. Ms. Miller was the daughter of Sophie and Lester Cornelius. She grew up in Richmond Hill, NY and attended Jamaica High School, thereafter working variously at The Sperry Company and The Singer Company. She also worked part-time as a fashion and television model for The Harry Conover Agency and Pendleton. Later in life, she went back to school, receiving two Associate Degrees from Queens College, New York. She was predeceased in 1998 by her beloved husband of 21 years, Willie, as well as her cherished longtime companion Robert Lovett, Sr. of Hampton Bays, NY in 2008. Dorothee was always cheery and quick with a smile, generous in her hospitality, unwavering in her opinions, independent to the last, and she will be missed greatly by her family and many friends. Ms. Miller is survived by her sister and brother-in-law, Joan and Richard Gibbs of Oak Creek, CO, her son and daughter-in-law, Todd and Lenore Evans of Remsenburg, NY, her son and daughter-in-law, Scott and Cynthia Evans of Chestertown, NY, and her grandchildren Alyssa, Cole, Casey, Kristin, Cody, and Jessie. According to Ms. Miller's wishes, there will be no funeral or memorial services. Her cremains will be scattered across Long Island Sound by her family. The family would appreciate that in lieu of flowers, a gift donation be made to The Betty Ford Legacy Fund in memory of Dorothee Miller, either online, or by calling 800-854-9211 x4105.","abstract":null,"print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  MILLER, DOROTHEE C"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MILLER, DOROTHEE C"}],"pub_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"4fd2ad818eb7c8105d89b52f","word_count":267},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2012\/09\/19\/sports\/soccer\/ap-soc-quick-hits-alex-morgan.html","snippet":"Alex Morgan and her U.S. soccer teammates are on a victory tour after winning the gold medal at the London Olympics.
