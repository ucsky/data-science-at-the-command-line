He also demonstrated a relatively new sartorial inversion, dressed as he was in a Levi's denim shirt with pointed pockets and pearl snap buttons, a pair of self-striped cotton Bermuda shorts and a broad-brimmed straw hat bought the previous week at a thrift store, with a brass key pendant draped around his neck.","abstract":"Many young beach-bound New Yorkers use the Rockaway Beach boardwalk as a venue for showing off their eclectic fashion sense.
