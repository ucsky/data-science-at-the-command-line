(13) G\u00d6TTERD\u00c4MMERUNG Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle concludes with this fourth installment, conducted at the Metropolitan Opera by Fabio Luisi and starring Deborah Voigt, above, as Br\u00fcnnhilde and Jay Hunter Morris as Siegfried, whose love is torn apart by the curse of the ring. Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Tommasini called this five-hour production, presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met,'' ''the most theatrically effective staging of the four works in this epic series, and the clearest representation of the director Robert Lepage's vision.'' Still, he said of the 45-ton mechanical set at the center of the cycle, ''Part of me wanted to see the machine collapse into a heap of smoldering planks at the end of the Immolation Scene, which would have been appropriate.'' 9:15 A.M. (MoreMax) THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (2011) Matt Damon, his toothy grin hinting at a young Robert F. Kennedy, portrays David Norris, a Democratic son of Brooklyn and a favorite in the New York race for the United States Senate. That is, until a damaging photo from his past does in his campaign, and he meets Elise (Emily Blunt), a dancer who innocently causes him to veer off the path that a team of mystery men have secretly plotted for him. Their plan does not include Emily, or free will on David's part, for that matter. Now he must decide whether to give in to their machinations -- or reclaim his life. If George Nolfi, who directed this film and wrote the screenplay, based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, ''doesn't go deep in 'The Adjustment Bureau,' a drilling down to where it hurts (he would rather entertain than pain you), he skates on the gray-blue surfaces of his film with confidence,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times.","abstract":null,"print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What's On Today"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-09-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kathryn","lastname":"SHATTUCK"}],"original":"By KATHRYN SHATTUCK"},"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"505b98db1c22dfde670c9f71","word_count":696},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/04\/01\/fashion\/yoga-mat-helps-doctor-maintain-extensive-regimen-possessed.html","snippet":"Dr. Fredric Brandt, who helped bring Botox treatments into vogue, is devoted to yoga and his mat.","lead_paragraph":"Dr. Fredric Brandt, who helped bring Botox treatments into vogue, is devoted to yoga and his mat.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2012\/04\/01\/fashion\/01POSSESSED1_SPAN\/01POSSESSED1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","height":360,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2012\/04\/01\/fashion\/01POSSESSED1_SPAN\/01POSSESSED1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"360"},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"thumbnail","url":"images\/2012\/04\/01\/fashion\/01POSSESSED1_SPAN\/01POSSESSED1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"width":75,"legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2012\/04\/01\/fashion\/01POSSESSED1_SPAN\/01POSSESSED1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"Yoga Mat Helps Doctor Maintain Extensive Regimen \u2014 Possessed","main":"A Firm Look for Exercise","kicker":"Possessed","print_headline":"A Firm Look for Exercise"},"keywords":[{"value":"Botox (Drug)","is_major":"N","rank":"1","name":"subject"},{"value":"Yoga","is_major":"Y","rank":"3","name":"subject"},{"value":"Brandt, Frederic","is_major":"Y","rank":"2","name":"persons"}],"pub_date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Styles","section_name":"Fashion & Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"David","lastname":"COLMAN"}],"original":"By DAVID COLMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"515b64d6fdc59278db009759","word_count":"744"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/02\/10\/us\/gtt.html","snippet":"Our quirky, discerning picks for the most interesting things to do around the state this week.","lead_paragraph":"Our quirky, discerning picks for the most interesting things to do around the state this week.

You think of Lady Gaga. But when it comes to doling out credit, one would have to hand out a goodly share of responsibility for our real-world poker-face pandemic to Dr. Fredric Brandt, a dermatologist. Some 15-odd years ago, Dr. Brandt burst onto the scene as a leading practitioner of (and proselytizer for) an alarming-sounding method of easing wrinkles by paralyzing subcutaneous muscles with injections of botulism toxin. Back then, Botox sounded completely insane, if not lethal. Now, there are precious few people willing, or able, to arch an eyebrow at its use.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Firm Look for Exercise","kicker":"POSSESSED"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"David","lastname":"COLMAN"}],"original":"By DAVID COLMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd100238eb7c8105d5bacd1","word_count":802},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2012\/12\/20\/sports\/hockey\/20reuters-yearender-nhl.html","snippet":"National Hockey League (NHL) Commissioner Gary Bettman kicked off 2012 toasting the New Year at the lucrative outdoor Winter Classic game, painting a glowing picture of a league whose stock was on the rise.","lead_paragraph":"National Hockey League (NHL) Commissioner Gary Bettman kicked off 2012 toasting the New Year at the lucrative outdoor Winter Classic game, painting a glowing picture of a league whose stock was on the rise.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Lockout Dampens Year Where Kings Reign Supreme"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2012-12-20T21:40:58Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"REUTERS","original":"By REUTERS","person":[]},"type_of_material":"","_id":"50d3cf6c00315214fbb8097d","word_count":741},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/06\/01\/us\/gtt.html","snippet":"Quirky, discerning picks for the most interesting things to do around Texas this week.","lead_paragraph":"HOUSTON Spaced Out","abstract":null,"print_page":"21B","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2012\/06\/01\/us\/01ttgone\/01ttgone-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2012\/06\/01\/us\/01ttgone\/01ttgone-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"GTT","kicker":"TEXAS MONTHLY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"TEXAS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"PHOTOGRAPHY"}],"pub_date":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Michael","lastname":"HOINSKI"}],"original":"By MICHAEL HOINSKI"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2c5328eb7c8105d8b1f81","word_count":756},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2012\/09\/27\/world\/europe\/27reuters-china-luxury-travel.html","snippet":"Rich Chinese tourists paying $40,000 to hunt elk in Utah or booking the entire first-class cabin for a family flight to France show China's economic slowdown has yet to thin the wallets or dull the appetites of its deep-pocketed elite.","lead_paragraph":"Rich Chinese tourists paying $40,000 to hunt elk in Utah or booking the entire first-class cabin for a family flight to France show China's economic slowdown has yet to thin the wallets or dull the appetites of its deep-pocketed elite.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Downturn?
