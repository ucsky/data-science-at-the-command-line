For spring, the company is continuing its 60th-anniversary celebration by reissuing 16 styles that express the whimsical essence of the line. Included is a soft silk crepe blouse designed by Ms. Aghion in 1960; the very rock \u2019n\u2019 roll black-and-gold cutout dress with a violin motif designed by Karl Lagerfeld in 1983; Stella McCartney\u2019s pineapple T-shirt from 2001; and the kind-of-daffy high-waist jeans (2004), Paddington \u201cit\u201d bag (2005) and chunky wedge sandals (2006) from Phoebe Philo\u2019s reign as designer at the house. They are at Barneys New York and Net-a-Porter this week and at Chlo\u00e9 boutiques on Monday. Prices range from $300 to $34,275 (that would be a croc Paddington).","abstract":"Chloe is reissuing 16 iconic styles that express whimsical essence of the fashion label in celebration of its 60th anniversary.
